                    As unlikely as it may seem, I was largely unaware of this
                    book before setting off on my 11,000 mile ski journey. I
                    knew Jack Kerouac was a famous American writer & <i>On the
                    Road</i> was perhaps his most well known work. Presumably
                    about being on the road. But that's all I knew. As I read it
                    I am delighted at some of the similarities between his
                    journeys and my own. Mine, of course, involve much less
                    hitchhiking. But while I was not <i>directly</i> influenced by this
                    book, I was certainly <i>indirectly</i> influenced. I can almost
                    guarantee that my travel writing spirit animal, Bill Bryson,
                    drew inspiration from this novel, as well as the many others
                    that undeniably did the same.

                    Time travel and alien encounters are not what you'd expect
                    from an anti-war novel by an author who lived through the
                    horrors of the fire bombing of Dresden. But that's exactly
                    what we have here. A younger me would have taken it at face
                    value & just said "well that's a weird book." However, when
                    you realize what he's trying to tell you through these
                    narrative devices (it's really not that thinly veiled) you
                    begin to realize the absurdity of the human condition.
                    His insouciant tone throughout somehow makes the senseless
                    bloodshed even more heartbreaking. So it goes.

                  <p>History</p>
                  <p class="card-text mb-0">
                    I found this title in the visitor center at Redwood National
                    Park. I was on the lookout for a book related to the
                    way of life of the indigenous peoples of the Redwood forests,
                    and while this is a more general overview of all
                    civilizations of the American continents, I deemed it worthy
                    of my interest. Mann's main thesis is centered on the
                    historical underestimation of the level that indigenous
                    societies molded the environment to suit their needs. The
                    conception by many of a "pristine" pre-Columbian American
                    continent is turned on its head. Mann goes a little too
                    deep into the weeds on some stories that aren't as relevant
                    to the overall theme of the book, but aside from that it's
                    an illuminating read on the early history of the peoples
                    of the Western Hemisphere.

                    I'm on an early American history kick right now & happened
                    across this title while perusing the shelves at Magic City
                    Books in Tulsa. It's a really great look into the influence
                    that the ancient scholars of Greece & Rome had on the
                    Founding Fathers. My only minor quibbles are a bit of editorializing at the
                    beginning that I didn't really care for (although I do
                    agree with him) and a bit in the middle about
                    Washington's military history that I found fascinating but
                    didn't seem to flow with the thesis of the book, but those
                    are minor qualms in an otherwise outstanding read. My
                    used bookstore list has grown substantially from reading
                    this book.
