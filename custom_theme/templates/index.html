                  <p>Medicine; Science; Medical History</p>
                  <p class="card-text mb-0">
                  A disease as old as humanity, tumors have been found in fossilized
                  remains of our ancestors that were walking the Earth thousands
                  of years ago. In this epic work, Mukherjee guides the reader
                  on a journey to the beginnings of our understanding of this disease
                  (we meet Galen of course), the long standing attempt to find a
                  cure, and the current state of cancer research. We make detours
                  through Halstead's ill advised radical mastectomy, the advances,
                  setbacks, and deadends of chemotherapy, and the retrospectively
                  wasteful and premature War on Cancer. This is truly a masterpiece
                  and a must read for the layman to understand the difficulties
                  and complexities of dealing with a disease as obstinately
                  pernicious as cancer.

                  The ski bum. How much is legend, how much is fact? What
                  are the roots of the men (and they were mostly men) who scratched
                  out a living on the periphery of ski towns just to experience
                  the momentary surge of adrenaline that comes with ripping the
                  perfect line on a powder day. Hansman talks to what seems like
                  the last of a dying breed to discover the history, the stories,
                  the secrets of the iconic ski bum. With the corporatization of the
                  ski industry is there even a place for the ski bum anymore?

                  <p class="card-text mb-0">
                  You'd be hard pressed to find a funnier writer than David Sedaris.
                  He makes the most mundane aspects of the modern human experience
                  brutally hilarious with an acerbic wit and matter-of-fact delivery.
                  From the highs and lows of a large Greek family, to the loss of
                  a sibling, Sedaris brings his unique perspective and storytelling
                  to even the darkest of topics. I nearly read this cover to cover
                  on a flight. Do yourself a favor and grab it today.

                  <p class="fst-italic text-semimuted fs-5 mb-0">Adam Grant</p>
                  <p>Psychology; Personal Growth</p>
                  <p class="card-text mb-0">
                  Organizational psychologist Adam Grant of TED Talk fame dives
                  into commonly held beliefs and urges the reader to *ahem*
                  <i>think again</i>. The ideas are fresh, though I wouldn't
                  imagine anybody under 40 would consider them revolutionary.
                  There are a few good tidbits in there but I think an
                  introspective personality would arrive at the same conclusions
                  as Dr. Grant. But maybe that's what led him to compile the
                  mounds of research to back up his points in the first place.
                  In any case his writing style is light and informal, with a
                  flippant sense of humor that I appreciate. I'd like to see
                  what a more headstrong personality would think of it.

                    That bottle of whiskey sitting on your bar cart with a photo
                    of a bearded ol' settler and a story about how the recipe
                    for this particular hooch has been passed down by pappys for
                    generations? Well that's all bullshit. That's not to say it
                    ain't good whiskey. It's just that nearly all whiskeys can
                    only trace their origins to the 20th century, plus the vast
                    majority are only made by a handful of mega-conglomerate
                    distillers with technology that would make NASA mission
                    control blush. Mitenbuler traces the earliest iterations of
                    fermenting corn, the All-American grain, through to present
                    day. Your Jim Beams, your Evan Williamses, your Makers Marks,
                    they are all represented, as well as the burgeoning "craft"
                    whiskey market, aiming to cater to traditional methods and
                    local ingredients. This book earns a full 5 Old Fashioneds

                      not hit her, I did <b>nottt!</b> Oh hi Mark!
                    </i>
                    And so goes one of the most (in)famous lines of *The Room*,
                    possibly the worst movie of all time with the grandest of
                    aspirations. I was lucky enough to watch a live screening of
                    *The Room* at the Carolina Theatre with commentary and Q&A
                    from Greg Sestero, the author & portrayer of Mark. I'd been
                    wanting to watch the movie for quite a few years because I'd
                    heard how terrible it was and boy was I not disappointed.
                    Greg even signed my book "Oh hi, Andrew," which was a nice
                    touch that he's probably done thousands of times. The book
                    is a fascinating look into the process of making a movie
                    with one of the strangest specimens of *Homo Sapiens* to ever
                    walk the planet, who legitimately might be a vampire.

                    I am delighted at some of the similarities between his
                    journeys and my own. Mine, of course, involve much less
                    hitchhiking. But while I was not <i>directly</i> influenced by this
                    book, I was certainly <i>indirectly</i> influenced. I can almost
                    guarantee that my travel writing spirit animal, Bill Bryson,
                    drew inspiration from this novel, as well as the many others
                    that undeniably did the same.

                    Time travel and alien encounters are not what you'd expect
                    from an anti-war novel by an author who lived through the
                    horrors of the fire bombing of Dresden. But that's exactly
                    what we have here. A younger me would have taken it at face
                    value & just said "well that's a weird book." However, when
                    you realize what he's trying to tell you through these
                    narrative devices (it's really not that thinly veiled) you
                    begin to realize the absurdity of the human condition.
                    His insouciant tone throughout somehow makes the senseless
                    bloodshed even more heartbreaking. So it goes.

                  <p class="card-text mb-0">
                    I found this title in the visitor center at Redwood National
                    Park. I was on the lookout for a book related to the
                    way of life of the indigenous peoples of the Redwood forests,
                    and while this is a more general overview of all
                    civilizations of the American continents, I deemed it worthy
                    of my interest. Mann's main thesis is centered on the
                    historical underestimation of the level that indigenous
                    societies molded the environment to suit their needs. The
                    conception by many of a "pristine" pre-Columbian American
                    continent is turned on its head. Mann goes a little too
                    deep into the weeds on some stories that aren't as relevant
                    to the overall theme of the book, but aside from that it's
                    an illuminating read on the early history of the peoples
                    of the Western Hemisphere.

                    I'm on an early American history kick right now & happened
                    across this title while perusing the shelves at Magic City
                    Books in Tulsa. It's a really great look into the influence
                    that the ancient scholars of Greece & Rome had on the
                    Founding Fathers. My only minor quibbles are a bit of editorializing at the
                    beginning that I didn't really care for (although I do
                    agree with him) and a bit in the middle about
                    Washington's military history that I found fascinating but
                    didn't seem to flow with the thesis of the book, but those
                    are minor qualms in an otherwise outstanding read. My
                    used bookstore list has grown substantially from reading
                    this book.

                    & MTV News. Each essay takes the reader on an adventure to a
                    part of the globe that's overlooked, undervalued, or
                    completely unknown to the rest of the world. Talking about
                    the book with a friend, I said that his writing is
                    "mesmerizing and ordinary at the same time," a perfect
