Drive from Nafplio to Vodka beach
Short hike & sunset
Stay at 3 charities
Sunrise
Big hike & swim

We slept in before heading out to explore the town on foot. First order of
business is breakfast, so we make a 10 minute walk through the windy, narrow
streets of old Nafplio to YiaYia brunch & more, a
recommendation from the bubbly receptionist at the hotel.
