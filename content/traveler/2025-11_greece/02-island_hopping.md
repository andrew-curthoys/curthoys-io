Walden Galleria, 29 November, 2024.

The scene of a 

"Stacy, did you know they re-stage the 'original' marathon each year? They run
from Marathon to Athens, the OG"

I say to my Anastasia Nichols, my cousin Marty's wife, who helped sustain me
through grad school in Ithaca, NY.

Before Stacy can respond, my mom jumps in,

"Oh! Andrew! You should run that! I want to go to Greece!"

Turns to Stacy, "Stacy, we're going to Greece, do you have some recommendations
for us?"

And that's the moment I went from "maybe I'll run the Athens marathon" to
"well shit, I'm running the Athens marathon."

I thought you'd never ask

*jump cut*

5 hours earlier, we land at PHL airport, located just downstream of the
confluence of the Schuylkill and Delaware Rivers, the natural boundaries 
of the questionably cognomened City of Brotherly Love. Our original plan for the
extended layover in Philly was mostly centered around Shannon's certain
somnolence - when we booked the flights she was scheduled to work the overnight
shift the night before, meaning I would pick her up from work in a bleary-eyed
daze. But three days before the trip we got some good news,

"Oh my god!! Kristen took my overnight!!"

"The one before we leave for Greece?"

"YES!!"

"No way!! That's incredible!!"

"I know!! I'm so excited!!"

So instead of spending the entire layover in the minute suites catching up on
some well deserved sleep we set a course for the Chase Sapphire lounge.

"It says you can only 3 hours before your flight takes off"

"Well I guess we can try and if they don't let us in we can grab a coffee and
hang out for an hour"

"Rules are meant to be broken"

"Please don't tell that to our children"
