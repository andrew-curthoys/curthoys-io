<h4 class="article-subheader">Bravo! Bravo!</h4>

Onto the wide coastal plain where the outmanned Athenian hoplites defeated
the armies of the Persian Empire in the Battle of Marathon in 490 BCE.

The first 3 miles run along the coastal plain between 



<h4 class="article-subheader"></h4>

I take a right from the hotel and walk about half a mile due north to Omonia
Square, one of the 6 pickup locations in Athens for marathon runners. I sidle
up to a blob of runners gathered on a street corner beside a line of buses that
stretch down the block and around the corner. The mob slowly shuffles toward the
corner where I assume we are boarding, but I am mistaken. Once we get to the
corner the throng snakes to the right around a building and stretches, 5 people
wide, for 4 blocks. How are there this many people 

As I board the bus I count the rows of seats and surmise there are around 60
seats. With 25,000 people participants that's over 400 buses!! And that's not
counting any support staff. What a logistical feat.

I find a seat about halfway back on the right next to a thin gentleman with
olive complexion and a tightly cropped beard. He doesn't appear much for talking,
which is just as fine with me. I slouch in my seat, put some music on my
headphones, and close my eyes to snag some much needed rest from Hypnos.

An hour later our bus pulls into the Marathon Athletic Park under a light
drizzling rain. Thousands of athletes are swarmed about like the tailgate lot
outside a football game. As I step off the bus I quickly learn that Europeans
have a much more laissez-faire attitude towards public urination - dozens of
men casually water a low wall between the buses and a field dotted with a few
women watering the crops.

I make my way through the crowds, past a statue of Nike, over patches of squishy
mud, and around a mob of people with a mild sense of modesty waiting in line
for the porta-johns (or as they call them over there, chemical toilets). At the
heart of the athletic park is a track-ringed field surrounded by a small stadium
of marble benches.

Each participant has been assigned a wave based on anticipated galloping pace
and my respectable saunter in <a href="">New York</a>
has landed me in wave 5. This positions me on the outside of the stadium, along
the road where the race begins. We have over an hour till the starting gun so I
find a nice stretch of unoccupied marble and lay down on my back, face to the
drizzle, to try to get a few more winks.

With 15 minutes to race time I begrudgingly peel myself up off the ground and
shuffle over to the corral for wave 5. Run clubs, friend groups, bucket listers,
all waiting with nervous anticipation for the starting gun. I don't
understand any of the words flying around my head, spoken in tongues foreign
to me, but I can feel the energy. The electricity in the air is strong as a
thunderstorm. It's as if mighty Zeus has sprinkled a dusting of lightning
bolts upon the crowd like a crack of black pepper upon a spanikopita.

At 9 AM sharp the starting gun erupts for wave 1. These are the runners whose
locomotion resembles the winged sandals of Hermes. They speak incessantly of PRs.
They have a *race plan*. They probably got a good night's sleep.

They will be enjoying a greek coffee and bougatsa in Athens by noon.

A handful of cracks from the starting gun later and wave 5 has reached the
starting line. To the right of the crowd a DJ pumps dance music from an
elevated platform. Everybody is bopping & grooving, the mass of runners roiling
in a syncopated rhythm like swells upon the Adriatic. As the time draws nigh
the DJ begins a countdown

<h4 class="article-subheader">The Hill</h4>
At the end of a moderate mile-long downhill section we reach the most grueling
section of the race. Mile 11. The start of 9 miles of unrelenting uphill. A
climb that would take you from the streets of Manhattan to the top floor of the
Chrysler Building.

Just one foot in front of the other. Follow the blue line.

As luck would have it, I am prepared for this. And I say luck because hill
training was no part of my regimen, Durham just happens to be moderately hilly.
A typical training session would go like this, "hmmm ok I haven't been through
that neighborhood, let's make a loop down through there and see where it takes
me."

While plodding through my 19 mile training run I managed to climb over 1,100 ft,
which is no small feat. (I did stop halfway through for coffee & pastries with
Shannon which surely ensmallens the feat).

During my training, as my mileage increased, I made note of the public
water fountains around the city, so that I never had to carry water.

So I am physically prepared for the hill, but am I mentally?

I entered this race begrudgingly, trained reluctantly, and aspired moderately.
I have no qualms about going slow. But I make myself a rule: no walking. I must
take an uncompromising position because I know how easily I can convince myself
to reduce my gait to a stroll. Why take this position? I'm not completely sure,
perhaps it's to inflate my sense of accomplishment; perhaps it's to get this
damn thing over with more quickly; most likely it's to hold moral superiority
over the throngs of moseying competitors who have capitulated to their natural
pain-aversion instincts.

Thankfully, as the hill begins the density of the spectators increases. A road
lined with joyous Greeks shouting *BRAVO!! BRAVO!!* provides an inexplicable
jolt to my fortitude.
