<h4 class="article-subheader">The Cheesecake Factory</h4>
This story begins at the Walden Galleria shopping mall, Buffalo, NY.
29 November, 2024.

Seated at a long table <s>on the warehouse floor of an industrial confectionery
manufacturing facility plant</s> at the Cheesecake Factory, 9 diners at the
intersection of the Nichols - Curthoys family lines (make small talk).

While perusing page 89 of the <s>inventory product catalog</s> menu, I blurt out
to my cousin Marty's wife,

"Stacy, did you know they run the 'original' marathon each year? From Marathon
to Athens, just like that one guy, what was his name Philly-peedees something?"

Before Stacy can respond, my mom jumps in,

"Oh! Andrew! You should run that! I want to go to Greece!"

Then, without missing a beat, turns to Stacy, "Stacy, we're going to Greece, do
you have any recommendations for us?"

And that's the moment I knew I blundered. The moment I went from "maybe I'll run
the Athens marathon" to "well shit, I'm running the Athens marathon."

<h4 class="article-subheader">Should We Get A Walking Negroni?</h4>
5 hours earlier, we land at PHL airport, located just downstream of the
confluence of the Schuylkill and Delaware Rivers, the natural boundaries 
of the questionably cognomened City of Brotherly Love. Our original plan for the
extended layover in Philly was mostly centered around Shannon's certain
somnolence - when we booked the flights she was scheduled to work the overnight
shift the night before, meaning I would pick her up from work in a bleary-eyed
daze. But three days before the trip we got some good news,

"Oh my god!! Kristen took my overnight!!"

"The one before we leave for Greece?"

"YES!!"

"No way!! That's incredible!!"

"I know!! I'm so excited!!"

So instead of spending the entire layover in the minute suites catching up on
some well deserved sleep we set a course for the Chase Sapphire lounge.

"It says you can only 3 hours before your flight takes off"

"Well I guess we can try and if they don't let us in we can grab a coffee and
hang out for an hour"

"Rules are meant to be broken"

"Please don't tell that to our children"

We confidently stroll up to the concierge and hand over our documents. The agent
looks at our boarding passes, glances at the computer, pauses for a split
second to ponder the time constraint, then a thought bubble appears over her
head with the words "fuck it" as she sighs and hands back our boarding passes
with a smile.

Once inside we nestle into a small round table set against a bench booth that
runs the length of the wall. A tall waitress in a dark button down and striped
apron comes to take our order. After a quick scan of the surprisingly
appetizing cocktail menu we settle on the *Sapphire*, the signature cocktail of
the lounge seemingly constructed by a bartender with a bucket of
ingredient-labeled fridge magnets tossing a handful at the walk-in door just to
see what happens. As described by the menu: "**Sapphire** *the essence of a
traveler's love of discovery, created with Bluecoat Dry Gin, blueberry,
goldenberry, lime, ginger, oregano, five-spice powder, bee pollen, and pearl
dust.* If I gave you the option of "cocktail" or "vacuum bag" for the question
of "where do pollen and dust belong" I'm sure most would pick the latter.

The cocktails have a nice balance of tart and sweet, a little fruit with some
herbal complexity that hits the spot. I can surely say that it's the best
cocktail I've ever had at an airport. I can also surely say that the number of
cocktails I've had at airports is less than the number of 

To accompany the cocktail we split a nice pasta with red sauce and a burger,
brought to us by what I'm now finding out is a buzzing Philly gastropub, Middle
Child Clubhouse. If you told me that Middle Child Clubhouse was an 80s movie
with Cory Feldman I'd believe you.

Seeing as we have 4 more hours here we do some exploring of the sprawling 20,000
square foot lounge. Off to our right we find a gaming room that  a kids play area, which I'm sure
weary parents 

"Well we have about 30 minutes till they start boarding, we should probably pack
up and head over to our gate"

"Should we get a walking Negroni?"

"Thought you'd never ask"
