<h4 class="article-subheader">The Sun</h4>
As I walk through the doors of the Munchmuseet
<span class="skewed">Monumental</span> exhibit I see it. I was expecting to be
wowed but I find myself completely bowled over with astonishment. Edvard
Munch's marvelous *The Sun* spews rays of bright, beautiful sunshine
across its sprawling canvas. Stretching *26 feet across and 15 feet high*, the
painting was pithily described by Munch, "I saw the sun rise up above the
rocks - I painted the sun."

This prodigious painting isn't even his most massive. *The Reserchers*, a
painting of children digging and exploring in the sand, measures an
astounding 16' x 36'. It's a surreal experience to stand beside these
remarkable works of art, if not for the artistry of it all but the logistics of
creating these monstrosities, let alone transporting and hanging them.

Speaking of...

The Munchmuseet (Edvard Munch Museum) is a controversial addition to the Oslo
skyline.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Oslo as Nature</h4>
Tucked away at at the head of the Oslofjord, it feels strange to call the
capital of a wealthy European nation *sleepy*,


While not a *technically* a fjord in the geologic sense, the Oslofjord falls
under the loosely defined Norwegian concept of a fjord. In Norway a fjord is a
vibe. Whatever you decide to call it, the waterway puts Oslo into the highest
tier of my city rankings, *Cities With Harbors*. I just love myself a great
harbor.

After recovering from the debauchery of the 17th I decide to get a survey of
the main confluence flowing through Oslo to the fjord. The Akerselva (Aker River)
starts at Maridalsvannet (Lake Maridal) about 5 miles north of the city center
and the main source of drinking water for Oslo.

Sondre's apartment sits approximately halfway from source to mouth. An athlete
with sufficient gumption could run the entire length of the Akerseva in an
afternoon. I decide to break it up into two separate days. Over the course of
those two days I run about 80% of the length of the river and its 500??? ft
elevation gain, which I think is a relatively admirable achievement considering
I'm on holiday.

One interesting(th) feature of the fjord is the scattered islands within a
short ferry ride of downtown Oslo. On a particularly delightful Norwegian May
day I decide to take one such ferry to the island of (??). The ferry
runs every 30 minutes(??) in a loop of (??) islands.

I hop on the boat with my sights set on (??) Island. According to my research
there's a nice little cafe on the island that seems the perfect setting to soak
up the rays from the afternoon sun hanging high in the sky. A quick 20 minute
ride later and I'm livin' on island time. I wander the trails for about half an
hour, taking in the sights and breathing in the nature before rambling over to
(??) Cafe.

I order myself a snack(??) and beer(??).


But the fjord does not only lend itself to skirting *on top* of the water, much
fun can also be had *in* the water. Lining the fjord opposite the Opera House &
Munch museum sit a handful of saunas affording the opportunity to partake in the
time honored Scandinavian tradition of hot sauna/cold plunge.

Sondre suggests (??) so I meet him and Nora, along with Will and Anna, at the
far end of sauna row. Unlike the rest of the saunas we are time constrained(??)
if we want to take part in the *ritual*.

Once checked in we all shuffle into a sauna room with three rows of tiered
benches. Everyone takes a seat and the most aggressively beautiful woman I've
ever seen in my life floats into the sauna with a bundle of accessories. She
explains, in a slightly aggressive(th) tone, that the *ritual* will last
approximately 10 minutes and under no circumstances will there be any talking.
Just sit back and let the vibes wash over you.

After the announcements she turns up the hypnotic music and begins the ritual.
She starts by dipping a birch bough into a basin of water and spritzes everyone
like a priest flinging holy water. She then turns up the heat and begins
spinning a towel 'round her head like a helicopter, distributing the heat with
a mesmerizing pattern of steam and smoke. We then sit in meditative silence for
another 5 minutes or so before she concludes the ritual by placing ice-soaked
towels over everyone's shoulders. Dreadnought

After the ritual we head to the main sauna house, a 30-40 foot tall structure
with rows upon rows of tiered wooden benches. We find a spot about 3/4 of the
way up the room and let the hot air work its magic. After the recommended 20
minutes of sweating we emerge from the sauna with our sights set on the fjord.

With a quick, slightly worried glance between my compatriots and a 1-2-3 count,
we all take the plunge into the frigid, Scandinavian water. The initial jolt
from the cold water is exhilarating. We tread water for a few seconds before
scampering back to the ladder and the warmth of our towels. I have to admit the
sauna/cold plunge combo was one of the most refreshing activities I've ever
experienced.


And the vibe in Oslo is *casually modern*

The next morning I strap on my running boots and hit the Akerselva trail.
Although I don't feel inclined to at the present moment, it wouldn't be
inconceivable to run the entire length in one go as the entire extent of the
waterway is 5 miles.  The
mighty Akerselva is the main river running through Oslo

<h4 class="article-subheader">Oslo as Lifestyle</h4>
After walking around Oslo for a couple days I take in a breath of fresh air and
it hits me how polluted American cities are. The streets of Oslo are mostly
devoid of automobiles, owing to it's walkability and fabulous public transit
system, and based on an informal survey it feels like 90% of the cars on the
road are electric.
Oslo as a great place to live
* Public transit
* Not many cars
* Almost all cars are electric
