<h4 class="article-subheader">The Sun</h4>
As I walk through the doors of the Munchmuseet's 6th floor
<span class="skewed">Monumental</span> exhibit I'm momentarily blinded by
brilliance. Stretching a staggering *26 feet across and 15 feet high*, the
canvas of Edvard Munch's marvelous *The Sun* spews rays of bright, beautiful sunshine
across its sprawling canvas.  the
painting was pithily described by Munch, "I saw the sun rise up above the
rocks - I painted the sun." I was expecting to be
wowed but I find myself completely bowled over with astonishment. 

This prodigious painting isn't even his most massive. *The Reserchers*, a
painting of children digging and exploring in the sand, measures an
astounding 16' x 36'. It's a surreal experience to stand beside these
remarkable works of art, if not for the artistry of it all but the logistics of
creating these monstrosities, let alone transporting and hanging them.

Speaking of...

<h4 class="article-subheader">Oslo as Culture</h4>
Commanding an inviting or ominous presence on the Oslo waterfront depending on
who you ask, the Munchmuseet (Edvard Munch Museum) is easily the most
controversial edifice gracing the Oslo skyline. The angular, 13-story "vertial
museum" seems to bow towards the Oslofjord, as an old man with his
hands clasped behind his back asking the fjord what he learned in school today.

The (few) proponents of the structure point to its distinctive architecture,
sustainability bona-fides, and respectful, bow-like posture towards the Oslo
city center, Opera House, & Oslofjord. Opponents claim it's harsh, orthogonal
lines mar stick out like a . Others still point to the fact that the museum now blocks the
view of the fjord to some of the lower economic neighborhoods in the shadow
of the museum.

<p class="article-sub-subheader">"Your accent, where's it from?"</p>

"I'm Australian, originally from Melbourne"

"No way! I love Australia, I have a cousin in Perth!"

And that's how I met Talor Browne, the owner of
<a href="https://talormade.no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talormade</a>,
a neon obeliscolychny attracting Oslofolk far and wide with its irresistible
good vibes, outstanding coffee, and mouthwatering doughnuts. Asked
how the heck she ended up 10,000 miles from home on the other side of the world,
she briefly regales her quest to find the perfect cup of coffee.

Originally departing the land of Oz for a Parisian cafe in the early 2010s,
Talor happened to meet Tim Wendelboe, a goliath in the world of specialty coffee.
This chance encounter led to Talor working her way up to head roaster in Timmy W's
outfit. After slingin' beans with the 'boe she got a hankerin' to set off on
her own. After a few years of hosting wildly popular doughnut pop-ups (oh yeah, 
she's a trained pastry chef, nbd) and running her own roastery, Talor opened her
first brick-and-mortar location of Talormade in February 2020.

And that's exactly where I'm standing right now, eager to slam my first proper
flat white since 2019, "well seeing as you hail from down under I'm
gonna have to order a flat white"

"Great idea!"

As I take a seat on a plush purple couch Talor calls out over the din of the
espresso machine, "hey, have you ever had a cappuccino al freddo?"

"I have no idea what that is"

"Well it just feels like a cappuccino al freddo day & I'm going to make myself
one, would you like to try one?"

"Damn right I would!"

Talor fills me in on the cap al fred - originating in the Greek islands, this
cold coffee drink involves dolloping cold, extremely frothy milk over a couple
shots of iced espresso and topping it with a dash of cocoa powder. I don't
know where in that process Talor imbued witchcraft because I pick up the glass
and can't believe how light it is. *Is this glass filled with air??? What is
happening???* I take a sip and my brain further spirals into a meltdown of
incomprehension, this drink is *impossibly* smooth.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Oslo as Nature</h4>
Tucked away at at the head of the Oslofjord, it feels strange to call the
capital of a wealthy European nation *sleepy*,


While not a *technically* a fjord in the geologic sense, the Oslofjord falls
under the loosely defined Norwegian concept of a fjord. In Norway a fjord is a
vibe. Whatever you decide to call it, the waterway puts Oslo into the highest
tier of my city rankings, *Cities With Harbors*. I just love myself a great
harbor.

<p class="article-sub-subheader">The Akerselva</p>

After recovering from the debauchery of the 17th I decide to get a survey of
the main confluence flowing through Oslo to the fjord. The Akerselva (Aker River)
starts at Maridalsvannet (Lake Maridal) about 5 miles north of the city center
and the main source of drinking water for Oslo.

Sondre's apartment sits approximately halfway from source to mouth. An athlete
with sufficient gumption could run the entire length of the Akerseva in an
afternoon. I decide to break it up into two separate days. Over the course of
those two days I run about 80% of the length of the river and its 500??? ft
elevation gain, which I think is a relatively admirable achievement considering
I'm on holiday.

#### Pictures of the Akerselva

One interesting(th) feature of the fjord is the scattered islands within a
short ferry ride of downtown Oslo. On a particularly delightful Norwegian May
day I decide to take one such ferry to the island of (??). The ferry
runs every 30 minutes(??) in a loop of (??) islands.

I hop on the boat with my sights set on (??) Island. According to my research
there's a nice little cafe on the island that seems the perfect setting to soak
up the rays from the afternoon sun hanging high in the sky. A quick 20 minute
ride later and I'm livin' on island time. I wander the trails for about half an
hour, taking in the sights and breathing in the nature before rambling over to
the cafe at Gressholmen Kro. I order a small charcuterie plate and soak in the
sublime Scandinavian weather with the bright crispiness of a Christiania
Bryggeri pilsner.

<p class="article-sub-subheader">Nordic Cycle</p>
The fjord lends itself not only to skirting *atop* the water, just as much
fun can be had *in* the water. Lining the fjord opposite the Opera House &
Munch museum sit a handful of saunas affording the opportunity to partake in the
time honored Scandinavian tradition of hot sauna/cold plunge, also known as
*The Nordic Cycle*

Sondre suggests SALT, a self-proclaimed "cultural arena" with six saunas, six
music stages, and indoor & outdoor bars. The *cultural arena* is right on the
fjord opposite the Opera House & Munch Museum. I meet him and Nora,
along with Will and Anna, for a round of Aperol Spritzes before our schvitzes.
We mustn't dally too long, however, since unlike the rest of the saunas we must
be punctual if we want to take part in *the ritual*.

Once checked in we all shuffle into a sauna room with three rows of tiered
benches. Everyone takes a seat and the most aggressively beautiful woman I've
ever seen in my life floats into the sauna with a bundle of accessories. She
explains, in a slightly threatening tone, that *the ritual* will last
approximately 10 minutes and under no circumstances will there be any talking.
Just sit back and let the vibes wash over you.

After the announcements she turns up the hypnotic music and thus begins, what I
now know is called, the *aufguss*. Our aufgussmeister (I just learned that
word) begins by passing around a container of ice that my fellow aufgussters and
I r

From there she cranks up the heat before theatrically
spinning a towel 'round her head like a helicopter, distributing the heat with
a mesmerizing pattern of steam and smoke. As the steam circulates through the
sauna, our sauna shaman pours a wooden ladle-ful of water & essential oils onto the
sauna coals, releasing a billow of lung-invigorating steam into the air. She
continues to fan the vapors, each revolution of her towel emitting a distinctive
*whoosh* sound.

She starts by  dipping a birch bough into a basin of water and spritzes everyone
like a priest flinging holy water.  We then sit in meditative silence for
another 5 minutes or so before she concludes the ritual by placing ice-soaked
towels over everyone's shoulders. Dreadnought

After the ritual we head to the main sauna house, a 30-40 foot tall structure
with rows upon rows of tiered wooden benches. We find a spot about 3/4 of the
way up the room and let the hot air work its magic. After the recommended 20
minutes of sweating we emerge from the sauna with our sights set on the fjord.

With a quick, slightly worried glance between my compatriots and a 1-2-3 count,
we all take the plunge into the frigid, Scandinavian water. The initial jolt
from the cold water is exhilarating. We tread water for a few seconds before
scampering back to the ladder and the warmth of our towels. I have to admit the
sauna/cold plunge combo was one of the most refreshing activities I've ever
experienced.


And the vibe in Oslo is *casually modern*

The next morning I strap on my running boots and hit the Akerselva trail.
Although I don't feel inclined to at the present moment, it wouldn't be
inconceivable to run the entire length in one go as the entire extent of the
waterway is 5 miles.  The
mighty Akerselva is the main river running through Oslo

<h4 class="article-subheader">Oslo as Lifestyle</h4>
After walking around Oslo for a couple days I take in a breath of fresh air and
it hits me how polluted American cities are. The streets of Oslo are mostly
devoid of automobiles, owing to it's walkability and fabulous public transit
system. Based on a *vibes only* informal personal survey it feels like 90% of
the cars on the road are electric.

For a European capital I'm amazed at how intimate Oslo feels. With a
metropolitan population of 1.5 million, Oslo would slot 42nd in the US metro
area population rankings, between Oklahoma City and Milwaukee. Which seems
preposterous to me. While I've never really considered the population of the Oslo
Metropolitan Area, I still can't believe that it's comparable to *Oklahoma City*.

What Oklahoma City lacks in transit and density Oslo boasts in droves. At any
point you're no more than a block or two from a subway, tramway, or bus route
that can efficiently ferry you about the city. Due to its
relatively small footprint (from a quick glance at a map it seems at least
75% of the city would fit inside a 5 mile radius of the city center) it feels
like everywhere in Oslo is *20 minutes away*.
