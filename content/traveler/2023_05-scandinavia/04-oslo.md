<h4 class="article-subheader">The Sun</h4>
As I walk through the doors of the Munchmuseet's 6th floor
<span class="skewed">Monumental</span> exhibit I'm momentarily blinded by
brilliance. Stretching a staggering *26 feet across and 15 feet high*, the
canvas of Edvard Munch's marvelous *The Sun* spews rays of bright, beautiful sunshine
across its sprawling canvas.  the
painting was pithily described by Munch, "I saw the sun rise up above the
rocks - I painted the sun." I was expecting to be
wowed but I find myself completely bowled over with astonishment. 

This prodigious painting isn't even his most massive. *The Reserchers*, a
painting of children digging and exploring in the sand, measures an
astounding 16' x 36'. It's a surreal experience to stand beside these
remarkable works of art, if not for the artistry of it all but the logistics of
creating these monstrosities, let alone transporting and hanging them.

Speaking of...

<h4 class="article-subheader">Oslo as Culture</h4>
Commanding an inviting or ominous presence on the Oslo waterfront depending on
who you ask, the Munchmuseet (Edvard Munch Museum) is easily the most
controversial edifice gracing the Oslo skyline. The angular, 13-story "vertial
museum" seems to bow towards the Oslofjord, as an old man with his
hands clasped behind his back asking the fjord what he learned in school today.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">How do you do, fellow kids?</figcaption>
</figure>

The (few) proponents of the structure point to its distinctive architecture,
sustainability bona-fides, and respectful, bow-like posture towards the Oslo
city center, Opera House, & Oslofjord. Opponents claim it's harsh, orthogonal
lines mar stick out like a . Others still point to the fact that the museum now blocks the
view of the fjord to some of the lower economic neighborhoods in the shadow
of the museum.

</figure>

What cannot be debated, however, is the brilliance on display inside the
museum. With installations spanning 6 of the museum's floors (the others are
used for performances, administrative tasks, and a restaurant/bar) visitors
can spend a day at the museum and still not see all there is to see within its
capacious 500,000 square feet.

<p class="article-sub-subheader">"Your accent, where's it from?"</p>

"I'm Australian, originally from Melbourne"

"No way! I love Australia, I have a cousin in Perth!"

And that's how I met Talor Browne, the owner of
<a href="https://talormade.no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talormade</a>,
a neon obeliscolychny attracting Oslofolk far and wide with its irresistible
good vibes, outstanding coffee, and mouthwatering doughnuts. Asked
how the heck she ended up 10,000 miles from home on the other side of the world,
she briefly regales her quest to find the perfect cup of coffee.

Originally departing the land of Oz for a Parisian cafe in the early 2010s,
Talor happened to meet Tim Wendelboe, a goliath in the world of specialty coffee.
This chance encounter led to Talor working her way up to head roaster in Timmy W's
outfit. After slingin' beans with the 'boe she got a hankerin' to set off on
her own. After a few years of hosting wildly popular doughnut pop-ups (oh yeah, 
she's a trained pastry chef, nbd) and running her own roastery, Talor opened her
first brick-and-mortar location of Talormade in February 2020.

And that's exactly where I'm standing right now, eager to slam my first proper
flat white since 2019, "well seeing as you hail from down under I'm
gonna have to order a flat white"

"Great idea!"

As I take a seat on a plush purple couch Talor calls out over the din of the
espresso machine, "hey, have you ever had a cappuccino al freddo?"

"I have no idea what that is"

"Well it just feels like a cappuccino al freddo day & I'm going to make myself
one, would you like to try one?"

"Damn right I would!"

Talor fills me in on the cap al fred - originating in the Greek islands, this
cold coffee drink involves dolloping cold, extremely frothy milk over a couple
shots of iced espresso and topping it with a dash of cocoa powder. I don't
know where in that process Talor imbued witchcraft because I pick up the glass
and can't believe how light it is. *Is this glass filled with air??? What is
happening???* I take a sip and my brain further spirals into a meltdown of
incomprehension, this drink is *impossibly* smooth.

<p class="article-sub-subheader">Bar Lorry</p>
Ordered myself a G&T with Icelandic Eagle Gin, which was presented in a
splendid goblet and a glass bottle of tonic to adulterate as I see fit. The
sharp elixir perfectly complements the vibe of the Lorry, which I would best
describe as eclectic sophistication.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">That's how you present a cocktail!</figcaption>
</figure>

The bar/restaurant dates back to the 1870s and has been a favorite hangout for
notable Oslo writers, artists, & intellectuals throughout its history. Often
tortured artists would use their work they crafted while toiling in the booths
of the Lorry as currency for food & drinks. Many of these works are still
hanging on the walls!

With our cocktails in tow, Sondre, Nora, & I peruse the incredible assortment of
art and tchotchkes on display throughout the building. As described on Lorry's
website, *Lorry is known for its extraordinary and eclectic art collection,
carefully collected from all over the World through the years. Our walls are
decorated with 207 art works by over 70 artists.*

As we wander around the main dining area we marvel at the artwork, the
knick-knacks, the figurines, the zebra head, the display of dozens of
corkscrews, the model ships, the old beer bottles. Once again from their website,
*you are guaranteed surprises and absurdities everywhere you look. A visit to
Lorry will be remembered for a long time.*

I couldn't agree more. And the most unforgettable part of the entire bazaar is
the taxidermied giraffe wearing a bowtie at the top of the stairs.

<p class="article-sub-subheader">Izakaya</p>
One afternoon we're wandering around the Barcode when Nora exclaims, "Oh my
friend works at Vin Bj&oslash;rvika, let's see if she's working!"

So we make a quick ambulatory right turn and saunter up to a wine bar situated
on a promenade overlooking the fjord. Unfortunately Nora's friend is not on
shift but we circle up 'round a table on the promenade nonetheless.

I order a *Solitude Gigondas 2020* from the Rh&ocirc;ne Valley, a full-bodied
red blend of 70% Grenache, 20% Syrah, & 10% Cinsault, if for no other reason
than I've heard people who like wine say things about Cinsault. Can I remember
if they were good things about Cinsault or bad things about Cinsault? No. Will
I be able to taste the difference? Also no.

We accompany our vin with an order of charcuterie presented as a three-story
tower of epicurean delicacies that perfectly fits the vibe of our waterfront
environs on a beautiful afternoon.

As we tipple our wine a plan for supper coalesces.

We hop on scooters for the 2 mile journey to Izakaya through historic Oslo
neighborhoods. I can't imagine I would feel this comfortable riding on a
scooter in any city in the US. The streets are mostly devoid of automobile
traffic and those that are navigate the streets at a reasonable pace and are
deferential to pedestrians, cyclists, scooter-ers, and other non-car methods of
transport. It's wild.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Oslo as Nature</h4>
Tucked away at at the head of the Oslofjord, 


While not a *technically* a fjord in the geologic sense, the Oslofjord falls
under the loosely defined Norwegian concept of a fjord. In Norway a fjord is a
vibe. Whatever you decide to call it, the waterway puts Oslo into the highest
tier of my city rankings, *Cities With Harbors*. I just love myself a great
harbor.

One of the appealing features of the Oslofjord are her scattered islands within
a short ferry of downtown. On a particularly delightful sunny day I find myself
in the mood for a little salty air whipping through my hair. I check the ferry
schedule and find they run
every 30 minutes in a loop of 5 islands - Nakkholmen, Lind&oslash;ya,
Gressholmen, Bleik&oslash;ya, and (of course) Hoved&oslash;ya.

I hop on the boat with my sights set on Gressholmen. According to my research
there's a nice little cafe on the island that seems the perfect setting to soak
up the rays from the afternoon sun hanging high in the sky. 45 minutes and two
stops later I find myself livin' on island time.

Once disembarked, I wander for about a mile of the 3 mile trail encircling the
island and its nature preserve. The ramble works up an appetite and I get a
little tingle in my throat that just might be alleviated by a light, crisp
barley sandwich. I plop onto a bench on the patio at Gressholmen Kro, a
picturesque cafe overlooking the runway that once was. I order a small
charcuterie plate and wash it down with a Christiania Bryggeri pilsner. Just
what the allmennlege ordered!

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">A fabulous little island eatery.</figcaption>
</figure>

I discover that this island was the location of the original Oslo airport, which
I deem utterly preposterous until I find that it was only for seaplanes. Because
that's the most Viking thing I can think of.

<p class="article-sub-subheader">The Akerselva</p>
After recovering from the debauchery of the 17th I decide to get a survey of
the main confluence flowing through Oslo to the fjord. The Akerselva (Aker River)
starts at Maridalsvannet (Lake Maridal) about 5 miles north of the city center
and the main source of drinking water for Oslo.

Sondre's apartment sits approximately halfway from source to mouth. An athlete
with sufficient gumption could run the entire length of the Akerseva in an
afternoon. I decide to break it up into two separate days. Over the course of
those two days I run about 80% of the length of the river and its 500 ft
elevation gain, which I think is a relatively admirable achievement considering
I'm on holiday.

<figure class="figure">

  </div>
</figure>

The Akerselva was once the manufacturing heart of Oslo, as evidenced by the
scores of mills, factories, and other industrial-looking brick buildings along
its length. By the 1970s the river was heavily contaminated from 150 years of
unbridled industrial pollution, leading to an effort in the 80s to revitalize
the health of the river.

  </div>
</figure>

The initiative's success can be seen today through the
river's diverse flora & fauna, none of which I could identify, mainly owing to
the fact I can't read the Norwegian placards stationed along the walking path.
The entirety of the river has been turned into an eco-park and many of the
industrial buildings have been turned into restaurants, shops, bars, and lovely
attractions for Oslofolk to enjoy on a beautiful May day.

<p class="article-sub-subheader">Nordic Cycle</p>
The fjord lends itself not only to skirting *atop* the water, just as much
fun can be had *in* the water. Lining the fjord opposite the Opera House &
Munch museum sit a handful of saunas affording the opportunity to partake in the
time honored Scandinavian tradition of hot sauna/cold plunge, also known as
*The Nordic Cycle*.

Sondre suggests SALT, a self-proclaimed "cultural arena" with six saunas, six
music stages, and indoor & outdoor bars. The *cultural arena* is right on the
fjord opposite the Opera House & Munch Museum. I meet him and Nora,
along with Will and Anna, for a round of Aperol Spritzes before our schvitzes.
We mustn't dally too long, however, since unlike the rest of the saunas we must
be punctual if we want to take part in *the ritual*.

Once checked in we all shuffle into a sauna room with three rows of tiered
benches. Everyone takes a seat and the most aggressively beautiful woman I've
ever seen in my life floats into the sauna with a bundle of accessories. She
explains, in a slightly threatening tone, that *the ritual* will last
approximately 10 minutes and under no circumstances will there be any talking.
Just sit back and let the vibes wash over you.

After the announcements she turns up the hypnotic music and thus begins, what I
now know is called, the *aufguss*. Our aufgussmeister (I just learned that
word) begins by passing around a container of ice that my fellow aufgussters and
I r

From there she cranks up the heat before theatrically
spinning a towel 'round her head like a helicopter, distributing the heat with
a mesmerizing pattern of steam and smoke. As the steam circulates through the
sauna, our sauna shaman pours a wooden ladle-ful of water & essential oils onto the
sauna coals, releasing a billow of lung-invigorating steam into the air. She
continues to fan the vapors, each revolution of her towel emitting a distinctive
*whoosh* sound.

She starts by  dipping a birch bough into a basin of water and spritzes everyone
like a priest flinging holy water.  We then sit in meditative silence for
another 5 minutes or so before she concludes the ritual by placing ice-soaked
towels over everyone's shoulders. Dreadnought

After the ritual we head to the main sauna house, a 30-40 foot tall structure
with rows upon rows of tiered wooden benches. We find a spot about 3/4 of the
way up the room and let the hot air work its magic. After the recommended 20
minutes of sweating we emerge from the sauna with our sights set on the fjord.

With a quick, slightly worried glance between my compatriots and a 1-2-3 count,
we all take the plunge into the frigid, Scandinavian water. The initial jolt
from the cold water is exhilarating. We tread water for a few seconds before
scampering back to the ladder and the warmth of our towels. I have to admit the
sauna/cold plunge combo was one of the most refreshing activities I've ever
experienced.


And the vibe in Oslo is *casually modern*

The next morning I strap on my running boots and hit the Akerselva trail.
Although I don't feel inclined to at the present moment, it wouldn't be
inconceivable to run the entire length in one go as the entire extent of the
waterway is 5 miles.  The
mighty Akerselva is the main river running through Oslo
* Akerselva run

<h4 class="article-subheader">Oslo as Lifestyle</h4>
it feels strange to call the capital of a wealthy European nation *sleepy*,

After walking around Oslo for a couple days I take in a breath of fresh air and
it hits me how polluted American cities are. The streets of Oslo are mostly
devoid of automobiles, owing to it's walkability and fabulous public transit
system. Based on a *vibes only* informal personal survey it feels like 90% of
the cars on the road are electric.

For a European capital I'm amazed at how intimate Oslo feels. With a
metropolitan population of 1.5 million, Oslo would slot 42nd in the US metro
area population rankings, between Oklahoma City and Milwaukee. Which seems
preposterous to me. While I've never really considered the population of the Oslo
Metropolitan Area, I still can't believe that it's comparable to *Oklahoma City*.

What Oklahoma City lacks in transit and density Oslo boasts in droves. At any
point you're no more than a block or two from a subway, tramway, or bus route
that can efficiently ferry you about the city. Due to its
relatively small footprint (from a quick glance at a map it seems at least
75% of the city would fit inside a 5 mile radius of the city center) it feels
like everywhere in Oslo is *20 minutes away*.


<p class="article-sub-subheader">V&aring;lerenga</p>
On Constitution Day Eve Sondre has a day of sporting lined up for me. The
beloved hometown soccer squad V&aring;lerenga is hosting the lads from
Hamarkameratene (Hamar Comrades). Often abbreviated HamKam, the Comrades hail
from Hamar, a town 80 miles to the north of Oslo on lake Mj&oslash;sa,
Norway's largest lake and also home to Lillehammer.

Before the match we meet up at a pub near the stadium with Sondre's friend
Daniel, a HamKam supporter who is, we'll say *realistic* about his team's
chances. "We suck. This is a good match for your first V&aring;lerenga game."

It's still early but HamKam has not fired out of the gates, amassing a dismal
2-4-0 record to date. However, V&aring;lerenga ain't exactly sittin' in the
catbird seat with their 2-3-1 tally.

After a few beers at the pub we set off for Intility Arena. It's about a half
hour walk through some neighborhoods, not too far from the V&aring;lerenga
Kirke (Church), the inspiration for the team's anthem. At some point in the late
70s the church burned down, inspiring Trond Ingebretsen and his band
Bj&oslash;lsen Valsem&oslash;lle to pen the song *V&aring;lerenga Kjerke*
honoring the house of worship. Supporters of V&aring;lerenga football club have
adopted the song as their defacto anthem, belting it out left, right, & center
to support the club.

I plugged the lyrics into an online translator & it feels like the gist of the
song notes that once the roof of timber burned down the church now has the sky
itself as a roof. So that's pretty hardcore.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">It's not THE church, but it is indeed A church!</figcaption>
</figure>

As we approach the stadium we see a line at least 50 yards long of fans waiting
to be granted ingress to the stadium. Sondre whips out his phone and dahses off
what sounds like a few steps of making Swedish meatballs and casually walks
past the long line of antsy supporters. As we near the entrance to the stadium
a gentleman in a smart blue suit greets us behind a low wall of temporary
metal barricades.

"Hi I'm Daniel, nice to meet you!"

I look over at Daniel, then to Daniel, then back to Daniel. Reckon that's one
less name I have to remember.

Daniel escorts us past the fence & hands us a lanyard with a ticket. Daniel
is Sondre's friend and works for V&aring;lerenga in whatever official capacity
requires him to wear a blue suit to games. Whatever his job I'm thrilled to
lean into his hospitality because our tickets grant us access to the club level
beneath the home stand, the only place in the stadium where you can drink a
beer. Unlike our Stateside stadia, festooned with beer ads and vendors walking
the aisles lest you have to leave your seat for liquid refreshment, European
soccer arenas have mostly banned alcohol at games in no small part to the
advanced studies of hooliganry Europeans have amassed.

We walk past a line of people 50 yards long waiting to get into the stadium.
His other friend (also named Daniel) meets us at a

Club beers - two sausages in one lompe trick Sondre shows me.

Daniel H&aring;kans in the 24th. As halftime draws near we shuffle out to the
club for some halftime brewskis. Right as we're about to open the door to the
club we hear a roar erupt from the hometown faithful.

What I saw seems to be a bit of a high point for V&aring;lerenga - they finished
the season in 14th place of 16, placing them in a battle for relegation against
the winner of the promotion playoff from the Norwegian First Division (which is
actually the second-tier in Norwegian soccer. Soccer amirite?)

After a home & away with Kristiansund it was all tied up, sending the
competition to penalties, which V&aring;renga lost in heartbreaking fashion 5
goals to 4. So next year the lads will be slugging it out in the First Division
with hopes to be promoted back up with the big dogs.

A last little denoument for this story, as I was doing some light research
about the club I was delighted to see that a club legend on the pitch as well
as a former manager is cognominated Leif Eriksen.

Happy Leif Eriksen Day! Hinga Dinga Dargen!
