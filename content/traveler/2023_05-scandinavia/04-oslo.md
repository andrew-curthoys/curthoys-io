<h4 class="article-subheader">The Sun</h4>
As I walk through the doors of the Munchmuseet
<span class="skewed">Monumental</span> exhibit I see it. I was expecting to be
wowed but I find myself completely bowled over with astonishment. Edvard
Munch's marvelous *The Sun* spews rays of bright, beautiful sunshine
across its sprawling canvas. Stretching *26 feet across and 15 feet high*, the
painting was pithily described by Munch, "I saw the sun rise up above the
rocks - I painted the sun."
