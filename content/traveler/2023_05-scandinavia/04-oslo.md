<h4 class="article-subheader">The Sun</h4>
As I walk through the doors of the Munchmuseet
<span class="skewed">Monumental</span> exhibit I see it. I was expecting to be
wowed but I find myself completely bowled over with astonishment. Edvard
Munch's marvelous *The Sun* spews rays of bright, beautiful sunshine
across its sprawling canvas. Stretching *26 feet across and 15 feet high*, the
painting was pithily described by Munch, "I saw the sun rise up above the
rocks - I painted the sun."

This prodigious painting isn't even his most massive. *The Reserchers*, a
painting of children digging and exploring in the sand, measures an
astounding 16' x 36'. It's a surreal experience to stand beside these
remarkable works of art, if not for the artistry of it all but the logistics of
creating these monstrosities, let alone transporting and hanging them.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Oslo as Nature</h4>
Tucked away at at the head of the Oslofjord, it feels strange to call the
capital of a wealthy European nation *sleepy*,


While not a *technically* a fjord in the geologic sense, the Oslofjord falls
under the loosely defined Norwegian . In Norway a fjord is a vibe.

And the vibe in Oslo is *casually modern*

The next morning I strap on my running boots and hit the Akerselva trail.
Although I don't feel inclined to at the present moment, it wouldn't be
inconceivable to run the entire length in one go as the entire extent of the
waterway is 5 miles.  The
mighty Akerselva is the main river running through Oslo

* Fjord
* Sauna
* Island ferry


<h4 class="article-subheader">Oslo as Lifestyle</h4>
After walking around Oslo for a couple days I take in a breath of fresh air and
it hits me how polluted American cities are. The streets of Oslo are mostly
devoid of automobiles, owing to it's walkability and fabulous public transit
system, and based on an informal survey it feels like 90% of the cars on the
road are electric.
Oslo as a great place to live
* Public transit
* Not many cars
* Almost all cars are electric
* Soccer match
