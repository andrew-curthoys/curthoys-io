philosophy of simple ingredients

* Blonde
	* IBU 16
	* champagne yeast
	* hazyish wheaty
	* wheat & yeast are cold flavors

	* IBU 15
	* Based on filtration - more cloudy
	* 4 types motueka, simcoe, chinook, calista

	* IBU 46
	* Piney, resiny
* M&oslash;rk Guld
	* Dunkel
	* Traditionally bad back in the day
	* Dark lager
	* IBU 25

	* Caramel at the end
	* Goes great with Danish brown bread
