<h4 class="article-subheader">The Sun</h4>
You shouldn't stare directly at the sun.

Everybody knows that.

But on this beautiful Norwegian May afternoon I simply can't help myself.

Transfixed, my retinae lock on to the glowing orb, incapable of averting their
lustful gaze.

Blinded by its radiant corona.

Blinded, not by the ultraviolet radiation of our life-giving
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-type_main-sequence_star" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer no opener"> G-type main-sequence star</a>,
but by the brilliant rays of sunshine emanating from the
Munchmuseet's 6th floor <span class="skewed">Monumental</span> exhibit.

*The Sun*, a painting by Oslo's native son Edvard Munch, is a work that is
indescribably expansive. indescribably vibrant. indescribably expressive.
indescribably affecting. So indescribably indescribable that I am struggling to,
well, describe it.

Stretching a staggering *26 feet across* and *15 feet high*, the marvelous
painting irradiates bright, beautiful sunshine across its sprawling canvas.
In a statement that could be enshrined in the understatement hall of fame,
Munch pithily described his painting thusly: "I saw the sun rise up above the
rocks - I painted the sun."  

Standing beneath the painting I feel its warmth, letting the sun's rays wash
over me. I was expecting to be
wowed but I find myself completely bowled over with astonishment.

What is unclear is the sun rising? Or setting? Are we witnessing the aspirational
glow of boundless potential? Or the last glimmers of a brilliant memory?

Much the same as the earth rotates around the sun, the everlasting constant at
the center of our solar system, the key to all life on earth, so too do our
lives rotate around *The Sun*. We crawl, we tumble. We walk, we stub our toe.
We make friends, we lose touch. We fall in love, we mend a broken heart. We get
married, we have kids, we travel across oceans, we grow old. All the while
*The Sun*'s rays remain statically frozen in time, our lives rotating around
its magical glow. It's neither a rising or setting sun, its our perspective that
rises and sets around the painting.

This prodigious work isn't even his most massive. *The Reserchers*, a
painting of children digging and exploring in the sand, measures an
astounding 16' x 36'. It's a surreal experience to stand beside these
remarkable works of art, if not for the artistry of it all but the logistics of
creating these monstrosities, let alone transporting and hanging them.

Speaking of...

<h4 class="article-subheader">The Oslo Waterfront</h4>
Prior to the *Fjord City* urban renewal project in the mid-aughts, the Oslo
waterfront was an industrial snarl, clogged with maritime shipping infrastructure,
train yards, and the 8 lanes of European Route E-18. As part of the *Fjord City*
project, the port was moved to S&oslash;rhavna, the train yard was relocated,
and the highway was re-routed to a tunnel under the harbor.

These infrastructure improvements opened the waterfront, affording the citizens
of Oslo acres of prime fjordfront real estate to bask in their Scandinavian
happiness. The waterfront development is anchored by the Oslo Opera House, home
to the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet, and the Oslo Public Library, home
to.... a lot of books. 450,000 of them in fact.

One day, on a stroll along the waterfront, I pop into the library to try to
read them all in one go.

Opening at a banner time for public gathering - June 2020 - the Deichman
Bj&oslash;rvika Oslo Public Library embodies the philosophy and aesthetic of the
Oslo waterfront. On the design of the library, the architects remarked, "we
think we have succeeded in making a building that is huge, but at the same time
feels intimate so people can feel they belong there." Further, "here you will
find spaces for meeting, rehearsal rooms, gaming rooms, exhibition niches,
a record studio, silent reading rooms etc. Even though the books still have a
strong presence this library is designed first and foremost as a place for people."

With the design, the architects not only to bring people together, but to bring
them together while inviting the outside in. to create a building that would
bring people together while allowing the outside in. The facade of the building
is coated in windows and the roof boats three diagonal light shafts that allow
for sunlight to spill from the roof all the way to the ground floor.

The most striking feature of the building, however, is the fifth-floor
cantilever. Jutting 60 feet towards the fjord, the top floor of the library
boasts a bright amphitheater with gradual steps down to the fourth floor. The
cantilever serves multiple purposes, allowing breathtaking views of the
Oslofjord, while preserving street-level views of the Opera House.

The five-story building is designed in such a way
that each floor a

I was not blessed with the opportunity to grace the halls of the Opera House but
we did walk on *top* of it. Opened in 2008, the Oslo Opera House finds itself
in the small minority of structures in our built environment where it's
encouraged to walk on the roof. The winner of an open competition that bested
350 other entrants, the Opera House's exterior of white granite and Italian
carrara marble give the impression of an iceberg slinking away into the frigid
waters of the fjord. The building's sloped roof invites all who arrive to walk
upon her back, to mount the a humble gesture offering breathtaking views of the fjord and city

Joining the Opera House in the group of buildings that are generally revered
among Oslovians is the Diechman Bj&oslash;rvika Library. From the outside the
most stunning feature of the buildings is its stunning terraced cantilever. The
top floor reaches out towards the Oslofjord, providing a space for quiet
concentration & contemplation.

Upset that the Viking Ship Museum is closed. Closed from September 2021 until
2025.

The Norwegian Museum of Science and Technology sits a quarter mile from the
source of the Akerselva, where Maridalsvannet releases her stored precipitation
on its journey to the Osloflord. The museum wastes no time showcasing the
importance of the Akerselva with a 20' replica water wheel spinning just steps
inside the museum.

The museum's collection features scientific and historical artifacts that paved
the way for Norway's ascension to a modern industrial society. And in one case,
*literally* paved the way as the museum features the world's oldest surviving
steamroller, dating to 1878, 30 years before the advent of Ford's Model T.

To my utmost chagrin I am constrained for time today, as my ferry to
Copenhagen sets sail at 3 PM sharp. This museum trip is going to have to be

In 1764 Danish historian Peder Frederik Suhm, reflecting on Norway's place in
the scientific landscape of the era, remarked, "no country in Europe was in
worse circumstance for scientific growth and progress." This despite a leader of
European scientific discovery sitting just a short jaunt to the south in
Copenhagen, most notably at the *Royal Society of Sciences of Copenhagen*.

In an effort to bolster the scientific King Frederik V established *The Free
Mathematical School* in Oslo, and the *Royal Norwegian Mining Seminar* in
Kongsberg in the mid 18th Century.

This telescope was built in 1797 by Abraham Pihl, a Norwegian vicar who had
assisted Thomas Buffe at the observatory in Copenhagen. It features an
achromatic lens, a revolutionary technological advance for the time that
reduced the blurriness that was common in telescope lenses of the day that
suffered from chromatic & spherical aberration.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Munch</h4>
The Munchmuseet (Edvard Munch Museum) commands an inviting or ominous presence
on the shores of the Oslofjord depending on who you ask. It's easily the most
disputatious edifice gracing the Oslo skyline. The angular, 13-story "vertical
museum" seems to bow towards the Oslofjord, as old man with his
hands clasped behind his back talking to squirrels in the park.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">How do you do, fellow kids?</figcaption>
</figure>

The (few) proponents of the structure point to its distinctive architecture,
sustainability bona-fides, and respectful, bow-like posture towards the Oslo
city center, Opera House, & Oslofjord. Opponents claim it's harsh, orthogonal
lines mar an otherwise elegant skyline. Others contend that the museum blocks
the view of the fjord to some of the lower economic neighborhoods in the shadow
of its edifice.

It's nothing if not controversial.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Norwegians are notoriously reserved, let's see if

</figure>

But what the Munchmuseet lacks in architectural charm it boasts in mindblowing
works of art.

With installations spanning 6 of the museum's floors (the others are
used for performances, administrative tasks, and a restaurant/bar) visitors
can spend a day at the museum and still not see all there is to see within its
capacious 500,000 square feet.

The first three floors are dedicated to artists other than Munch, whetting our
artistic appetites for more floors to come.

As we wind through the halls of the museum I'm enthralled by the third floor's
*The Shape of Freedom* exhibit. Norway's largest exhibition of abstract
expressionism, or *art informel* as the Euros call it, tells a story of a world
recovering from war. These are the kinds of works that I'd have the natural
tendency to deride as "throwing paint at a wall" or "something a trained simian
could do, and it wouldn't even have to be trained that well."

But the museum does a masterful job of telling a story through their collection.
As you enter the exhibit you are welcomed by a series of pieces that portend the
storm clouds of war gathering over Europe. 

As you continue through the space the pieces slowly shift from an ominous sense
of impending doom to 
Photographs of tattered studios in war torn cities accompany works dominated by
dark colors and harsh lines. Dispersed between the pieces are are descriptions
of the milieu in which the artists lived and worked. Art is always an expression
of its time but I have to imagine wartime only emphasizes the degree to which
art reflects the world it is made within.

By end of the exhibit the mood of the pieces begin to gradually lighten,
reflective of a world emerging from the largest bloodletting in history,
hopeful for what lies ahead, thankful for surviving the carnage, and rueful for
having to live through a catastrophe completely out of their control.

The works, in their entirety, create

The lower floors hold a handful of other exhibits with titles such as *Lost in
Color* and *Painting the Unspeakable* that highlight works from Scandinavian
artists and a smattering of others from around the world. Each installation
tells a story, each installation complements the works of Edvard Munch to be seen
shortly in the floors above.

Norway's most celebrated artist, Edvard Munch was born in a farmhouse in the
small pastoral town of L&oslash;ten in 1863. Around his first birthday his
father was appointed medical officer at Akershus Fortress, then the Norwegian
royal palace, and moved the family 80 miles south to the city of Christiania.

Christiania was a city constructed from whole cloth by King Christian IV of
Denmark in 1624. After a fire destroyed the existing polity, Ol King Chris
decided to rebuild across the river and, of course, named it after himself.
In 1877 the name was changed to Kristiania, which lasted until 1 January 1925
when it was again renamed to... Oslo. The fact that their capital city was
named after a Dane just didn't sit right with the Norwegians.

As a child Munch often fell ill during the winters and was held out of school,
where he began to draw to keep himself occupied. Munch's mother died of
tuberculosis when he was just 5 years old, leaving his father Christian to raise
Edvard and his siblings alone. Despite his father's generally positive and
supportive parenting his overly pious demeanor had an effect on Edvard,
"My father was temperamentally nervous and obsessively religious—to the point of
psychoneurosis. From him I inherited the seeds of madness. The angels of fear,
sorrow, and death stood by my side since the day I was born."

This overbearing influence, combined with his mother's death and a
hypochondrical comportment, contributed to his distinctive macabre style.

All this is to say if you don't know who Edvard Munch is, he's the guy who
painted *The Scream.*

You know *The Scream*
