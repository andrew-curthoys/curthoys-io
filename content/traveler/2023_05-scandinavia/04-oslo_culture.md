<h4 class="article-subheader">The Sun</h4>
On a beautiful Norwegian May afternoon I find myself blinded while staring
directly at The Sun.

Blinded, not by the ultraviolet radiation of the life-giving
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-type_main-sequence_star" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer no opener"> G-type main-sequence star</a>
at the center of our solar system, but by the brilliant rays of sunshine
emanating from the massive canvas stretched before me on the wall of the
Munchmuseet's 6th floor <span class="skewed">Monumental</span> exhibit.

A painting so expansive, so vibrant, so expressive, so utterly indescribable
that it was described to me before I came and I'm still completely dumbfounded.

Stretching a staggering *26 feet across* and *15 feet high*, the of Edvard Munch's marvelous *The Sun* spews
rays of bright, beautiful sunshine
across its sprawling canvas.  the
painting was pithily described by Munch, "I saw the sun rise up above the
rocks - I painted the sun." I was expecting to be
wowed but I find myself completely bowled over with astonishment. 

This prodigious painting isn't even his most massive. *The Reserchers*, a
painting of children digging and exploring in the sand, measures an
astounding 16' x 36'. It's a surreal experience to stand beside these
remarkable works of art, if not for the artistry of it all but the logistics of
creating these monstrosities, let alone transporting and hanging them.

Speaking of...

<h4 class="article-subheader">Munch</h4>


With installations spanning 6 of the museum's floors (the others are
used for performances, administrative tasks, and a restaurant/bar) visitors
can spend a day at the museum and still not see all there is to see within its
capacious 500,000 square feet.

<h4 class="article-subheader">The Oslo Waterfront</h4>
The Munchmuseet (Edvard Munch Museum) commands an inviting or ominous presence
on the shores of the Oslofjord depending on who you ask. It's easily the most
disputatious edifice gracing the Oslo skyline. The angular, 13-story "vertical
museum" seems to bow towards the Oslofjord, as old man with his
hands clasped behind his back talking to squirrels in the park.

</figure>

The (few) proponents of the structure point to its distinctive architecture,
sustainability bona-fides, and respectful, bow-like posture towards the Oslo
city center, Opera House, & Oslofjord. Opponents claim it's harsh, orthogonal
lines mar an otherwise elegant skyline. Others contend that the museum blocks
the view of the fjord to some of the lower economic neighborhoods in the shadow
of its edifice.

It's nothing if not controversial.

Other notable denizens sharing the Oslo skyline with the Munchmuseet include the
Oslo Opera House and the Diechman Bj&oslash;rvika Central Public Library.

I was not blessed with the opportunity to grace the halls of the Opera House but
we did walk on *top* of it. Opened in 2008, the Oslo Opera House finds itself
in the small minority of structures in our built environment where it's
encouraged to walk on the roof. The winner of an open competition that bested
350 other entrants, the Opera House's exterior of white granite and Italian
carrara marble give the impression of an iceberg slinking away into the frigid
waters of the fjord. The building's sloped roof invites all who arrive to walk
upon her back, to mount the a humble gesture offering breathtaking views of the fjord and city

<h4 class="article-subheader">Library</h4>
Joining the Opera House in the group of buildings that are generally revered
among Oslovians is the Diechman Bj&oslash;rvika Library. From the outside the
most stunning feature of the buildings is its stunning terraced cantilever. The
top floor reaches out towards the Oslofjord, providing a space for quiet
concentration & contemplation.



Stats.

One lazy afternoon while wandering around the city center I duck into the
library to continue my wanderings in of doors. The most striking aspect of the
library is the massive atrium at its center. Waves of natural light wash
through the space,

Upset that the Viking Ship Museum is closed. Closed from September 2021 until
2025.

The Norwegian Museum of Science and Technology sits a quarter mile from the
source of the Akerselva, where Maridalsvannet releases her stored precipitation
on its journey to the Osloflord. The museum wastes no time showcasing the
importance of the Akerselva with a 20' replica water wheel spinning just steps
inside the museum.

The museum's collection features scientific and historical artifacts that paved
the way for Norway's ascension to a modern industrial society. And in one case,
*literally* paved the way as the museum features the world's oldest surviving
steamroller, dating to 1878, 30 years before the advent of Ford's Model T.

To my utmost chagrin I am constrained for time today, as my ferry to
Copenhagen sets sail at 3 PM sharp. This museum trip is going to have to be

In 1764 Danish historian Peder Frederik Suhm, reflecting on Norway's place in
the scientific landscape of the era, remarked, "no country in Europe was in
worse circumstance for scientific growth and progress." This despite a leader of
European scientific discovery sitting just a short jaunt to the south in
Copenhagen, most notably at the *Royal Society of Sciences of Copenhagen*.

In an effort to bolster the scientific King Frederik V established *The Free
Mathematical School* in Oslo, and the *Royal Norwegian Mining Seminar* in
Kongsberg in the mid 18th Century.

This telescope was built in 1797 by Abraham Pihl, a Norwegian vicar who had
assisted Thomas Buffe at the observatory in Copenhagen. It features an
achromatic lens, a revolutionary technological advance for the time that
reduced the blurriness that was common in telescope lenses of the day that
suffered from chromatic & spherical aberration.

"Munch Museum sucks"
https://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/arkitekt---jeg-vil-si-at-munchmuseet-suger/70816188

Architect Gaute Brochmann, editor of the journal Architecture N, describes it
thusly, (as translated by my internet browser)

<div class="block-quote">
"I say that the Munch Museum sucks, both in the sense that it does not look
good - but also in the sens that it sucks all light out of Bjorvika"
