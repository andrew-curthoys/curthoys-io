<h4 class="article-subheader">The Sun</h4>
You shouldn't stare directly at the sun.

Everybody knows that.

But on this beautiful Norwegian May afternoon I simply can't help myself.

Transfixed, my retinae lock on to the glowing orb.

Incapable of averting their bewitched gaze.

Blinded by its radiant corona.

Blinded, not by the ultraviolet radiation of our life-giving
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-type_main-sequence_star" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer no opener"> G-type main-sequence star</a>,
but by the brilliant flash of sunlight emanating from the
Munchmuseet's 6th floor <span class="skewed">Monumental</span> exhibit.

*The Sun*, a painting by Oslo's native son Edvard Munch, is a work that is
indescribably expansive. indescribably vibrant. indescribably expressive.
indescribably affecting. So indescribably indescribable that I am struggling to,
well, describe it.

Stretching a staggering *26 feet across* and *15 feet high*, the marvelous
painting irradiates bright, beautiful sunshine from its sprawling canvas.
"I saw the sun rise up above the rocks - I painted the sun," Munch once
pithily described his inspiration for the painting; a statement so modest it
borders on arrogance.

Standing beneath the painting I feel its warmth, I feel its resplendent rays
wash over me. I find myself contemplating, is the sun is rising? Or is it
setting? Are we witnessing the aspirational
glow of boundless potential? Or the last glimmers of a brilliant memory?

Just as the earth rotates around the sun, that eternal galactic constant, so too
do our lives rotate around *The Sun*. We crawl, we tumble. We walk, we stumble.
We make friends, we lose touch. We fall in love, we mend a broken heart. We get
married, we have kids, we travel across oceans, we grow old. All the while
*The Sun*'s rays remain statically frozen in time, our lives revolving around
its magical glow. It's neither a rising nor setting sun; it's our journey
through the human experience that rises and sets around the painting.

This prodigious work isn't even his most massive. *The Researchers*, a
painting of children digging and exploring in the sand, measures an
astounding 16' x 36'. That's nearly the size of a pickleball court.

The feeling is surreal standing beside these
remarkable works of art, if not for the artistry of it all but the logistics of
creating these monstrosities, let alone transporting and hanging them.

<h4 class="article-subheader" id="technology">Norsk Teknisk</h4>
Norsk Teknisk, i.e. the Norwegian Museum of Science and Technology, sits a
quarter mile from the source of the
<a href="/traveler/2023_05-scandinavia/05-oslo_nature?id=Aker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Akerselva River</a>;
steps from where Lake Maridalsvannet
releases her stored precipitation to begin its journey to the Osloflord. I've
decided to spend my final day in Oslo here because, I mean, have you met me?
Also the Viking Ship Museum is closed until 2025.

Norsk Teknisk wastes no time showcasing the importance of the Akerselva with a
20' replica water wheel spinning inside the main atrium.

The museum's collection features scientific and historical artifacts that paved
the way for Norway's ascension to a modern industrial society. And in one case,
*literally* paved the way as the museum features the world's oldest surviving
steamroller, dating to 1878, 30 years before the advent of Ford's Model T.

To my utmost chagrin I am constrained for time today, as my ferry to
Copenhagen sets sail at 3 PM sharp. By necessity I'll have to blow through this
institution at a pace that will not allow me to fully appreciate the science
and the technology. Alas.

In my whirlwind tour I find rooms dedicated to

<figcaption class="figure-caption">A Norwegian telescope built in 1797.</figcaption>
</figure>

In 1764 Danish historian Peder Frederik Suhm, reflecting on Norway's place in
the scientific landscape of the era, remarked, "no country in Europe was in
worse circumstance for scientific growth and progress." This despite a leader of
European scientific discovery sitting just a short jaunt to the south in
Copenhagen, most notably at the *Royal Society of Sciences of Copenhagen*.

In an effort to bolster Norway's scientific stature King Frederik V established
*The Free Mathematical School* in Oslo, and the *Royal Norwegian Mining Seminar*
in Kongsberg in the mid 18th Century.

This telescope was built by Abraham Pihl, a Norwegian vicar who had
assisted Thomas Buffe at the observatory in Copenhagen. It features an
achromatic lens, a revolutionary technological advance for the time that
reduced the blurriness that was common in telescope lenses of the day that
suffered from chromatic & spherical aberration.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Industry</h4>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">19th century steam engine.</figcaption>
</figure>

This steam engine was used to power dozens of machines at a factory using
a purely mechanical linkage. The steam engine would spin the large wheel,
turning a belt to power the smaller wheel overhead. This wheel was connected to
a shaft that ran along the ceiling of the workshop.

<figure class="figure">

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Steam & belt driven workshop.</figcaption>
</figure>

This shaft was fitted with numerous drive wheels, which were connected via belts
to drive shafts on either side of the workshop, which were in turn connected to
each machine.

This seems atavistic by today's standards but at the time it was
state of the art. From an engineering perspective it's fascinating to see each
component of a mechanical system laid bare. From a human perspective it's hard
not to imagine the interminable hours of excruciating work performed here; how
many digits, limbs, scalps caught in the drive belts - people caught in the
literal gears of society, an unseen cost of progress.


<h4 class="article-subheader">The Oslo Waterfront</h4>
Prior to the *Fjord City* urban renewal project in the mid-aughts, the Oslo
waterfront was an industrial snarl, clogged with maritime shipping infrastructure,
train yards, and the 8 lanes of European Route E-18. As part of the *Fjord City*
project, the port was moved to S&oslash;rhavna, the train yard was relocated,
and the highway was re-routed to a tunnel under the harbor.

These infrastructure improvements opened the waterfront, affording the citizens
of Oslo acres of prime fjordfront real estate to bask in their Scandinavian
happiness. The waterfront development is anchored by the Oslo Opera House, home
to the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet, and the Oslo Public Library, home
to.... a lot of books. 450,000 of them in fact.

One day, on a stroll along the waterfront, I pop into the library to try to
read them all in one go.

Opening at a banner time for public gathering - June 2020 - the Deichman
Bj&oslash;rvika Oslo Public Library embodies the philosophy and aesthetic of the
Oslo waterfront. On the design of the library, the architects remarked, "we
think we have succeeded in making a building that is huge, but at the same time
feels intimate so people can feel they belong there." Further, "here you will
find spaces for meeting, rehearsal rooms, gaming rooms, exhibition niches,
a record studio, silent reading rooms etc. Even though the books still have a
strong presence this library is designed first and foremost as a place for people."

With their design, the architects hoped to not simply bring people together,
but to bring them together while inviting the outside in. The building's
fa&ccedil;ade is wrapped with windows and the roof boasts three diagonal light
shafts that allow
for sunlight to spill from the roof all the way to the ground floor.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Not my photos, these are way better than any I took</figcaption>
</figure>

The most striking feature of the building, however, is the fifth-floor
cantilever. Jutting 60 feet towards the fjord, the top floor of the library
boasts a bright amphitheater with gradual steps down to the fourth floor. The
overhang serves multiple purposes, allowing breathtaking views of the
Oslofjord, while preserving street-level views of the Opera House.

While I was not blessed with the opportunity to grace the halls of the Opera
House I did walk on *top* of it. Opened in 2008, the Oslo Opera House finds
itself in the small minority of structures where the general public is
encouraged to walk on the roof. The winner of an open competition besting
350 other entrants, the Opera House's exterior of white granite and Italian
carrara marble give the impression of an iceberg slinking away into the frigid
waters of the fjord. The building's sloped roof invites all who arrive to walk
upon her back, to mount the humble structure, a gesture offering stunning
views of the fjord and city

The southerly view offers a glimpse into the joys of summertime Oslo - a throng
of epicureans in swimming costumes frolic and bask in the beautiful weather on a
beach fronting the Munch museum.

Just then a surly gull perches on the marble banister
an arms-length away. This bird, who I'll call Gustav, is perhaps another voice
in the crowd offering a take on the architecture of the Munch museum.

<h4 class="article-subheader skewed" style="font-style:normal !important;">Munch</h4>
The Edvard Munch Museum (stylized <span class="skewed">Munch</span>) commands an
inviting or ominous presence
on the shores of the Oslofjord depending on who you ask. It's easily the most
disputatious edifice gracing the Oslo skyline. The angular, 13-story "vertical
museum" seems to bow towards the fjord, as old man with his
hands clasped behind his back talking to squirrels in the park.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">How do you do, fellow kids?</figcaption>
</figure>

The (few) proponents of the structure point to its distinctive architecture,
sustainability bona-fides, and respectful, bow-like posture towards the Oslo
city center, Opera House, & Oslofjord. Opponents claim it's harsh, orthogonal
lines mar an otherwise elegant skyline. Still others contend that the museum blocks
the view of the fjord to some of the lower economic neighborhoods in the shadow
of the monolith.

It's nothing if not controversial.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Tell us how you really feel</figcaption>
</figure>

The author of the above take, architect Gaute Brochmann, editor of the journal
*Architecture N*, further clarifies in the article, (as translated by my
internet browser)

<div class="block-quote mb-2">
"I say that the Munch Museum sucks, both in the sense that it does not look
good - but also in the sense that it sucks all light out of Bjorvika"
</div>

But what the Munchmuseet lacks in architectural charm it abounds with
spectacular works of art.

With installations spanning 6 of the museum's 13 floors (the others are
used for performances, administrative tasks, and a restaurant/bar) visitors
can spend a day at the museum and still not see all there is to see within its
capacious 500,000 square feet.

As we wind through the halls of the museum I'm enthralled by the third floor's
*The Shape of Freedom* exhibit. Norway's largest exhibition of abstract
expressionism, or *art informel* as the Euros call it, tells a story of a world
recovering from war. These are the kinds of works that I'd have the natural
tendency to deride as "throwing paint at a wall" or "something a trained simian
could do, and it wouldn't even have to be trained that well."

But the museum does a masterful job of telling a story through their collection.
As you enter the exhibit you are welcomed by a series of pieces that portend the
storm clouds of war gathering over Europe in the 1930s. 

As you continue through the space the pieces slowly shift from an ominous sense
of impending doom to doom incarnate.
Photographs of tattered studios in war torn cities accompany works dominated by
dark colors and harsh lines. Dispersed between the pieces are are descriptions
of the milieu in which the artists lived and worked. Art is always an expression
of its time but I have to imagine wartime only emphasizes the degree to which
art reflects the world it inhabits.

By end of the exhibit the mood of the pieces begin to gradually lighten,
reflective of a world emerging from the largest bloodletting in history,
hopeful for what lies ahead, thankful for surviving the carnage, and rueful for
having to live through a catastrophe completely out of their control.

The rest of the lower floors present a handful of other exhibits with titles
such as *Lost in
Color* and *Painting the Unspeakable* that highlight works from Scandinavian
artists and a smattering of others from around the world. Each installation
tells a story, each installation complements the works of Edvard Munch to be seen
shortly in the floors above.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Edvard Munch</h4>
Norway's most celebrated artist, Edvard Munch was born in a farmhouse in the
small pastoral town of L&oslash;ten in 1863. Around his first birthday his
father was appointed medical officer at Akershus Fortress, then the Norwegian
royal palace, and moved the family 80 miles south to the city of Christiania.

Christiania was a city constructed from whole cloth by King Christian IV of
Denmark in 1624. After a fire destroyed the existing city, Ol King Chris
decided to rebuild across the river and, of course, named it after himself.
In 1877 the name was changed to Kristiania, which lasted until 1 January 1925
when it was again renamed to... Oslo. The fact that their capital city was
named after a Dane just didn't sit right with the Norwegians.

As a child Munch often fell ill during the winters and was held out of school,
where he began to draw to keep himself occupied. Munch's mother died of
tuberculosis when he was just 5 years old, leaving his father Christian to raise
Edvard and his siblings alone. Despite his father's generally positive and
supportive parenting his overly pious demeanor had an effect on Edvard,
"My father was temperamentally nervous and obsessively religious—to the point of
psychoneurosis. From him I inherited the seeds of madness. The angels of fear,
sorrow, and death stood by my side since the day I was born."

This overbearing influence, combined with his mother's death and a
hypochondrical comportment, contributed to his distinctive macabre style.

All this is to say if you don't know who Edvard Munch is, he's the guy who
painted *The Scream.*

You know *The Scream*

<figure class="figure container">
		<img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/traveler/2023_05-scandinavia/oslo-culture_skrik.jpg" alt="The Scream">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Y'know... that guy.</figcaption>
</figure>

So yeah, I didn't know who Edvard Munch was until I had already been in Oslo
a few days, "have you gone to the Munch museum yet?"

"Not yet, but it's on my schedule!" I confidently replied without a clue what
they were talking about. Later, when cloistered in the safety of my own
uncultured ignorance, I looked up this Munch fella.

Ohhhhh THAT guy!

I have a vague recollection of a dreadful attempt at recreating *The Scream* in
elementary school art class, but likely due to my incredibly untroubled and
stress free upbringing I just couldn't access *that pain behind those eyes*.

The inspiration for the piece was a sunset walk along the Oslofjord,

<p class="block-quote">
One evening I was walking along a path, the city was on one side and the fjord
below. I felt tired and ill. I stopped and looked out over the fjord – the sun
was setting, and the clouds turning blood red. I sensed a scream passing through
nature; it seemed to me that I heard the scream. I painted this picture, painted
the clouds as actual blood. The color shrieked. This became The Scream.
</p>

The painting is actually one of a series of works - two paintings with tempera
and oil, two drawings with pastel and crayon, and a few dozen prints from a
lithograph. The museum retains 8 versions of *The Scream* - one painting, one
drawing, and 6 lithograph prints.

As we ride the escalator to the 4th floor we leave the *non-Munch* section of
the museum and enter the Munch exclusive floors. And since they maintain nearly
*27,000* pieces of art by Munch we will not be wanting for art on the next 5
floors.

<span class="skewed">Munchmuseet</span>, fully ascribing to the
give-the-people-what-they-want philosophy of design, immediately satiate the
visitor's thirst for *Skrik*, as *The Scream* is called in Norwegian. The
exhibit consists of a dimly lit three-sided alcove featuring a different version of
*Skrik* on each wall. Since Munch created each version on paper or cardboard
they are more fragile than works on canvas. As a result they only display one
version at a time on a rotating schedule, while "the two others rest in
darkness" as the museum melodramatically describes.

The version on display during our visit is a black & white lithograph. While
the museum says that "all the versions are different, but equally powerful" I
have to day that I think the colored painting is probably more powerful. But
then again I have absolutely no idea what the hell I'm talking about.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Skriiiiiiiiiiiiik</figcaption>
</figure>

The rest of the 4th floor is filled with Munch's explorations of humanity,
filled with sections such as Oneself, Gender, In Motion, Love,
Others, Alone, Outdoors, To Die.

And a painting of a bartender who looks like Bill Murray.

<figure class="figure container">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">I'll have a Total Consciousness on the rocks</figcaption>
</figure>

I'm dancing perilously close to the cliffs of my artistic scholarship, so I better
quit now. All I have to say is the <span class="skewed">Munchmuseet</span> is
well worth a visit, despite the harshest critics' opinions of the exterior.

Hell even the the floors are beautiful.

Unfortunately the rooftop cafe is closed by the time we summit the charcoal-gray
brick, but we do make a stop in the Chamber of Chaos - a "fantastical,
imaginative play-space for children, where normal museum rules do not apply."

So we spend a few minutes breaking normal museum rules because who doesn't want
to act like a kid every once in a while?
