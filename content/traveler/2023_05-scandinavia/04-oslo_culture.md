<h4 class="article-subheader">The Sun</h4>
As I walk through the doors of the Munchmuseet's 6th floor
<span class="skewed">Monumental</span> exhibit I'm momentarily blinded by
brilliance.

The expansive canvas of Edvard Munch's *The Sun* stretches the brain's expanse of
credulity.

Dazzled by magnificent rays of sunshine

Stunned by wind battered cliffs

Bowled over by rolling ocean waves

The scene unfolding on the sprawling canvas outspread afore me renders me
speechless.

The staggering extent of the canvas gives the feeling of Edvard Munch's marvelous painting *The Sun*. Stretching a staggering *26 feet
across* and *15 feet high*, the  of Edvard Munch's marvelous *The Sun* spews rays of bright, beautiful sunshine
across its sprawling canvas.  the
painting was pithily described by Munch, "I saw the sun rise up above the
rocks - I painted the sun." I was expecting to be
wowed but I find myself completely bowled over with astonishment. 

This prodigious painting isn't even his most massive. *The Reserchers*, a
painting of children digging and exploring in the sand, measures an
astounding 16' x 36'. It's a surreal experience to stand beside these
remarkable works of art, if not for the artistry of it all but the logistics of
creating these monstrosities, let alone transporting and hanging them.

Speaking of...

<h4 class="article-subheader">Oslo as Culture</h4>
Commanding an inviting or ominous presence on the Oslo waterfront depending on
who you ask, the Munchmuseet (Edvard Munch Museum) is easily the most
controversial edifice gracing the Oslo skyline. The angular, 13-story "vertial
museum" seems to bow towards the Oslofjord, as an old man with his
hands clasped behind his back asking the fjord what he learned in school today.

The (few) proponents of the structure point to its distinctive architecture,
sustainability bona-fides, and respectful, bow-like posture towards the Oslo
city center, Opera House, & Oslofjord. Opponents claim it's harsh, orthogonal
lines mar stick out like a . Others still point to the fact that the museum now blocks the
view of the fjord to some of the lower economic neighborhoods in the shadow
of the museum.

What cannot be debated, however, is the brilliance on display inside the
museum. With installations spanning 6 of the museum's floors (the others are
used for performances, administrative tasks, and a restaurant/bar) visitors
can spend a day at the museum and still not see all there is to see within its
capacious 500,000 square feet.

Sha notable denizens of the skyline include the Oslo Opera House and the 

I was not blessed with the opportunity to grace the halls of the Opera House but
we did walk on *top* of it. Opened in 2008, the Oslo Opera House finds itself
in the small minority of structures in our built environment where it's
encouraged to walk on the roof. The winner of an open competition that bested
350 other entrants, the Opera House's exterior of white granite and Italian
carrara marble give the impression of an iceberg slinking away into the frigid
waters of the fjord. The building's sloped roof invites all who arrive to walk
upon her back, to mount the a humble gesture offering breathtaking views of the fjord and city
