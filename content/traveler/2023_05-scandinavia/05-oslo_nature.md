<h4 class="article-subheader">Oslo as Nature</h4>
Tucked away at at the head of the Oslofjord, the capital City of Norway offers
a panoply of natural wonders for any adventurer.

While not a *technically* a fjord in the geologic sense, the Oslofjord falls
under the loosely defined Norwegian concept of a *fjord*. If it's a salty body
of water it's probably a fjord. In Norway a fjord is a vibe.

If you're cool like the Norwegians and call it a fjord or lame like the
geological technocrats and call it... a bay?... Whatever you decide to call it,
the waterway puts Oslo into the highest
tier of my city rankings: *Cities With Harbors*. I just love myself a great
harbor.

One of the appealing features of the Oslofjord are her scattered islands within
a short ferry of downtown. On a particularly delightful sunny day I find myself
in the mood for a little salty air whipping through my hair. I check the ferry
schedule and find they run
every 30 minutes in a loop of 5 islands - Nakkholmen, Lind&oslash;ya,
Gressholmen, Bleik&oslash;ya, and (of course) Hoved&oslash;ya.

I hop on the boat with my sights set on Gressholmen. According to my research
there's a nice little cafe on the island that seems the perfect setting to soak
up the rays from the afternoon sun hanging high in the sky. 45 minutes and two
stops later I find myself livin' on island time.

Once disembarked, I wander for about a mile of the 3 mile trail encircling the
island and its nature preserve. The ramble works up an appetite and I get a
little tingle in my throat that just might be alleviated by a light, crisp
barley sandwich. I plop onto a bench on the patio at Gressholmen Kro, a
picturesque cafe overlooking the runway that once was. I order a small
charcuterie plate and wash it down with a Christiania Bryggeri pilsner. Just
what the allmennlege ordered!

I discover that this island was the location of the original Oslo airport, which
I deem utterly preposterous until I find that it was only for seaplanes. Because
that's the most Viking thing I can think of.

<p class="article-sub-subheader">The Akerselva</p>
After recovering from the debauchery of the 17th I decide to get a survey of
the main confluence flowing through Oslo to the fjord. The Akerselva (Aker River)
starts at Maridalsvannet (Lake Maridal) about 5 miles north of the city center
and the main source of drinking water for Oslo.

Sondre's apartment sits approximately halfway from source to mouth. An athlete
with sufficient gumption could run the entire length of the Akerseva in an
afternoon. I decide to break it up into two separate days. Over the course of
those two days I run about 80% of the length of the river and its 500 ft
elevation gain, which I think is a relatively admirable achievement considering
I'm on holiday.

The Akerselva was once the manufacturing heart of Oslo, as evidenced by the
scores of mills, factories, and other industrial-looking brick buildings along
its length. By the 1970s the river was heavily contaminated from 150 years of
unbridled industrial pollution, leading to an effort in the 80s to revitalize
the health of the river.

The initiative's success can be seen today through the
river's diverse flora & fauna, none of which I could identify, mainly owing to
the fact I can't read the Norwegian placards stationed along the walking path.
The entirety of the river has been turned into an eco-park and many of the
industrial buildings have been turned into restaurants, shops, bars, and lovely
attractions for Oslofolk to enjoy on a beautiful May day.

<p class="article-sub-subheader">Nordic Cycle</p>
The fjord lends itself not only to skirting *atop* the water, just as much
fun can be had *in* the water. Lining the fjord opposite the Opera House &
Munch museum sit a handful of saunas affording the opportunity to partake in the
time honored Scandinavian tradition of hot sauna/cold plunge, also known as
*The Nordic Cycle*.

Sondre suggests SALT, a self-proclaimed "cultural arena" with six saunas, six
music stages, and indoor & outdoor bars. The *cultural arena* is right on the
fjord opposite the Opera House & Munch Museum. I meet him and Nora,
along with Will and Anna, for a round of Aperol Spritzes before our schvitzes.
We mustn't dally too long, however, since unlike the rest of the saunas we must
be punctual if we want to take part in *the ritual*.

Once checked in we all shuffle into a sauna room with three rows of tiered
benches. Everyone takes a seat and the most aggressively beautiful woman I've
ever seen in my life floats into the sauna with a bundle of accessories. She
explains, in a slightly threatening tone, that *the ritual* will last
approximately 10 minutes and under no circumstances will there be any talking.
Just sit back and let the vibes wash over you.

After the announcements she turns up the hypnotic music and thus begins, what I
now know is called, the *aufguss*. Our aufgussmeister (I just learned that
word) begins by passing around a container of ice that my fellow aufgussters and
I r

From there she cranks up the heat before theatrically
spinning a towel 'round her head like a helicopter, distributing the heat with
a mesmerizing pattern of steam and smoke. As the steam circulates through the
sauna, our sauna shaman pours a wooden ladle-ful of water & essential oils onto the
sauna coals, releasing a billow of lung-invigorating steam into the air. She
continues to fan the vapors, each revolution of her towel emitting a distinctive
*whoosh* sound.

She starts by  dipping a birch bough into a basin of water and spritzes everyone
like a priest flinging holy water.  We then sit in meditative silence for
another 5 minutes or so before she concludes the ritual by placing ice-soaked
towels over everyone's shoulders. Dreadnought

After the ritual we head to the main sauna house, a 30-40 foot tall structure
with rows upon rows of tiered wooden benches. We find a spot about 3/4 of the
way up the room and let the hot air work its magic. After the recommended 20
minutes of sweating we emerge from the sauna with our sights set on the fjord.

With a quick, slightly worried glance between my compatriots and a 1-2-3 count,
we all take the plunge into the frigid, Scandinavian water. The initial jolt
from the cold water is exhilarating. We tread water for a few seconds before
scampering back to the ladder and the warmth of our towels. I have to admit the
sauna/cold plunge combo was one of the most refreshing activities I've ever
experienced.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Gausta</h4>
"I don't know if you have other plans but if you want we can go skiing tomorrow.
We have a cabin up in the mountains."

"Nope, no other plans."

*closes laptop in the middle of making plans for Stockholm tomorrow*

"We have a cabin up in the mountains" is the peak of understatement. Sondre may
have said we have a *condo* up in the mountains, but whatever the appellation
deemed appropriate for the accommodation I was not prepared for this:

</figure>

The 3 hour drive to the mountain begins as any good road trip does. With shitty
coffee and nonsense snacks procured at the first gas station you encounter as
you enter the amorphous region known as *the edge of town.*

If nonsense snacks had a European soccer-style hierarchy, one Norwegian treasure
would arrogantly reside in the top tier. The Norwegian gas station waffle, in no
fear of relegation, sneers at slim jims, laughs at pork rinds, chuckles at the
thought of combos. Nods respectfully at giant dill pickles in a bag. Doesn't
even acknowledge gummy candy.

The Norwegian gas
station waffle is a soggy surface-impressioned-leavened-batter-bread filled with
any conceivable edible morsel imaginable. In my case I choose a soggy waffle
filled with
<a href="/traveler/2023_05-scandinavia/02-saetre?id=cheese" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brunost</a>,
i.e. brown cheese.

It's mealy, it's flaccid, it's repulsive. And it's exactly what I want.

Sondre & I scarf down our roadwaffles with a hearty helping of brown water
masquerading as coffee.

And the vibe in Oslo is *casually modern*

The next morning I strap on my running boots and hit the Akerselva trail.
Although I don't feel inclined to at the present moment, it wouldn't be
inconceivable to run the entire length in one go as the entire extent of the
waterway is 5 miles.  The
mighty Akerselva is the main river running through Oslo
