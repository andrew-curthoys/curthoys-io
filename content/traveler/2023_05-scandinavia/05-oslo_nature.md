<h4 class="article-subheader">A Fjord By Any Other Name</h4>
Tucked away at at the head of the Oslofjord, Norway's capital city is blessed with an
embarrassment of natural riches. Strolling around town you find that the line
dividing city from nature is blurry, and oftentimes, nonexistent. There's even a
word for it - *Marka* - which describes the dense forest that surrounds, and
in the most benevolent way possible, ensnarls the city. Anywhere in the city
you'll find yourself within walking distance of forests, mountains, lakes,
rivers, or the great Oslofjord herself.

**Marka**- the name for the dense forest surrounding the city

While not a *technically* a fjord in the geologic sense, the Oslofjord falls
under the loosely defined Norwegian concept of a *fjord*. If you go by the
definition offered by Springer Reference's *Encyclopedia of Estuaries*, a fjord
is "a sea inlet that has inundated a trough
formed by glacial erosion, ranging in length from a few to hundreds of
kilometers. Although troughs erode rapidly under glacial conditions, many fjords
are erosionally complex, palimpsest features that formed over the course of
multiple glacial episodes."

Furthermore, the "cross-sectional profiles of fjords
can be described mathematically by empirical power-law functions or second-order
polynomials."

I thought I was out but you pulled me back in, *Encyclopedia of
Estuaries*. Well played.

To a Norwegian a fjord is, I dunno, like *that water out there*. In Norway a
fjord is a vibe.

If you're cool like the Norwegians and call it a fjord or lame like the
geological technocrats and call it... a bay?... the Oslofjord puts Oslo into the
highest tier of my city rankings: *Cities With Harbors*. I just love myself a
great harbor.

One of the most appealing features of the Oslofjord are her scattered islands
within a short ferry of downtown. As I'm rambling around the city center one
particularly delightful sunny day the tousled mop atop my head cries out for
a rush of salty air. I check the ferry schedule and find they run
every 30 minutes in a loop of 5 islands - Nakkholmen, Lind&oslash;ya,
Gressholmen, Bleik&oslash;ya, and (of course) Hoved&oslash;ya.

I hop on the boat with my sights set on Gressholmen. According to my research
there's a nice little cafe on the island that seems the perfect setting to soak
up the rays from the afternoon sun hanging high in the sky. 45 minutes and two
stops later I find myself livin' on island time.

Once disembarked, I wander for about a mile of the 3 mile trail encircling the
island and its nature preserve. The ramble works up an appetite and I get a
little tingle in my throat that just might be alleviated by a light, crisp
barley sandwich. I plop onto a bench on the patio at Gressholmen Kro, a
picturesque cafe overlooking the runway that once was. I order a small
charcuterie plate and wash it down with a Christiania Bryggeri pilsner. Just
what the allmennlege ordered!

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">A fabulous little island eatery.</figcaption>
</figure>

As I'm relaxing at the cafe I discover that this island was the location of the
original Oslo airport. This revelation I find utterly preposterous until I find
that it was only for seaplanes. Because that's the most Viking thing I can think of.


<h4 class="article-subheader">The Akerselva</h4>
After recovering from the debauchery of the 17th I decide to get a survey of
the main confluence flowing through Oslo to the fjord. The Akerselva (Aker River)
starts at Maridalsvannet (Lake Maridal) about 5 miles north of the city center
and the main source of drinking water for Oslo.

Sondre's apartment sits approximately halfway from source to mouth. An athlete
with sufficient gumption could leisurely round trip the entire length of the
Akerseva in an
afternoon. I decide to break it up into two separate days. Over the course of
those two days I run about 80% of the length of the river and its 500 ft
elevation gain, which I think is a relatively admirable achievement considering
I'm on holiday.

The Akerselva was once the manufacturing heart of Oslo, as evidenced by the
scores of mills, factories, and other industrial-looking brick buildings along
its length. By the 1970s the river was heavily contaminated from 150 years of
unbridled industrial pollution, leading to an effort in the 80s to revitalize
the health of the river.

</figure>

The initiative's success can be seen today through the
river's diverse flora & fauna, none of which I could identify, mainly owing to
the fact I can't read the Norwegian placards stationed along the walking path.
The entirety of the river has been turned into an eco-park and many of the
industrial buildings have been turned into restaurants, shops, bars, and lovely
attractions for Oslofolk to enjoy on a beautiful May day.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Nordic Cycle</h4>
The fjord lends itself not only to skirting *atop* the water, just as much
fun can be had *in* the water. Lining the fjord opposite the Opera House &
Munch museum sit a handful of saunas affording the opportunity to partake in the
time honored Scandinavian tradition of hot sauna/cold plunge, also known as
*The Nordic Cycle*.

Sondre suggests SALT, a self-proclaimed "cultural arena" with six saunas, six
music stages, and indoor & outdoor bars. The *cultural arena* is right on the
fjord opposite the Opera House & Munch Museum. I meet him and Nora,
along with Will and Anna, for a round of Aperol Spritzes before our schvitzes.
We mustn't dally too long, however, since unlike the rest of the saunas we must
be punctual if we want to take part in *the ritual*.

Once checked in we all shuffle into a sauna room with three rows of tiered
benches. Everyone takes a seat and the most aggressively beautiful woman I've
ever seen in my life floats into the sauna with a bundle of accessories. She
explains, in a slightly threatening tone, that *the ritual* will last
approximately 10 minutes and under no circumstances will there be any talking.
Just sit back and let the vibes wash over you.

After the announcements she turns up the hypnotic music and thus begins, what I
now know is called, the *aufguss*. Our aufgussmeister (I just learned that
word) begins by passing around a container of ice that my fellow aufgussters and
I r

From there she cranks up the heat before theatrically
spinning a towel 'round her head like a helicopter, distributing the heat with
a mesmerizing pattern of steam and smoke. As the steam circulates through the
sauna, our sauna shaman pours a wooden ladle-ful of water & essential oils onto the
sauna coals, releasing a billow of lung-invigorating steam into the air. She
continues to fan the vapors, each revolution of her towel emitting a distinctive
*whoosh* sound.

She starts by  dipping a birch bough into a basin of water and spritzes everyone
like a priest flinging holy water.  We then sit in meditative silence for
another 5 minutes or so before she concludes the ritual by placing ice-soaked
towels over everyone's shoulders. Dreadnought

After the ritual we head to the main sauna house, a 30-40 foot tall structure
with rows upon rows of tiered wooden benches. We find a spot about 3/4 of the
way up the room and let the hot air work its magic. After the recommended 20
minutes of sweating we emerge from the sauna with our sights set on the fjord.

With a quick, slightly worried glance between my compatriots and a 1-2-3 count,
we all take the plunge into the frigid, Scandinavian water. The initial jolt
from the cold water is exhilarating. We tread water for a few seconds before
scampering back to the ladder and the warmth of our towels. I have to admit the
sauna/cold plunge combo was one of the most refreshing activities I've ever
experienced.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Gausta</h4>
"I don't know if you have other plans but if you want we can go skiing tomorrow.
We have a cabin up in the mountains."

"Nope, no other plans."

*closes laptop in the middle of making plans for Stockholm tomorrow*

"We have a cabin up in the mountains" is the peak of understatement. Sondre may
have said we have a *condo* up in the mountains, but whatever the appellation
deemed appropriate for the accommodation I was not prepared for this:

<figure class="figure">

</figure>

The 3 hour drive to the mountain begins as any good road trip does. With shitty
coffee and nonsense snacks procured at the first gas station you encounter as
you enter the amorphous region known as *the edge of town.*

If nonsense snacks had a European soccer-style hierarchy, one Norwegian treasure
would arrogantly reside in the top tier. The Norwegian gas station waffle, in no
fear of relegation, sneers at slim jims, laughs at pork rinds, cackles at the
thought of combos. He nods respectfully at giant dill pickles in a bag. He
doesn't even acknowledge gummy candy.

The Norwegian gas station waffle is a soggy
surface-impressioned-leavened-batter-bread filled with whatever conceivable
edible morsels a maniac in charge of such things sees fit. In my case the soggy
waffle is filled with the Norwegian delicacy
<a href="/traveler/2023_05-scandinavia/02-saetre?id=cheese" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brunost</a>,
i.e. brown cheese.

It's mealy, it's flaccid, it's repulsive. And it's exactly what I want.

Sondre & I scarf down our roadwaffles with a hearty helping of brown water
masquerading as coffee. The first hour and a half of the drive is a tranquil
jaunt through the idyllic rolling hills of the Norwegian countryside.

<p class="mb-0">We see bridges</p>

Gaustatoppen appears between two mountains</p>

I let out an audible gasp when G-top finally reveals his snowy crest. What
stands out is not only his enormous stature but his singularity, standing alone,
stoically towering over his arboreally endowed neighbors.

While nowhere near the top of the list of highest peaks in Norway (which are mostly located
on the west coast, vestiges of the Caledonian Orogeny, i.e. the mountain
building event that gave us the Appalachians & Scottish Highlands), GTop as it's
colloquially known, is near the top of the list of most visited, due to its
breathtaking views and proximity to Oslo.

As we approach the mountain Sondre tells me about Rjukan, a small town sitting
in the northern shadow of Gaustatoppen. The town was essentially "built from
scratch" during the
construction of a fertilizer plant by Norsk Hydro in the early 20th century. At
the time of its completion in 1911 the Vemork hydroelectric power plant was the
world's largest hydroelectric power plant, larger even than the hydro plant at
Niagara Falls. The plant was also the site of Norwegian heavy water sabotage
operations during WWII, an effort to thwart the German's plant to build an
atomic bomb (although they were the harbingers of their own demise in that
arena, directly causing the exodus of hundreds of top scientists starting in 1933).

And when I say the town sits in the shadow of Gaustatoppen I mean it. Literally.
Every winter, from September to March their mountainous compadre completely blocks
the sun at all hours of the day. In 2013 local artist Martin Andersen
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170314-the-town-that-built-a-mirror-to-catch-the-sun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
constructed a series of mirrors</a>connected to a computer driven sun tracker to
spill sunlight upon the town square during these dismal months. According to
the town's mayor, “the sun mirror means a lot to Rjukan... It’s a perfect
combination of technology and art – and of course it is a great welfare activity
for the citizens of Rjukan.”

As we wind our way up the flanks of the mountain to Chalet Bratlie we see lines
of chairs, strung aloft, sitting idly, softly waving in the breeze. Seeing as
we're nearly into June the chairlifts of Gausta Skisenter stopped spinning
weeks ago. However, GTop still presides over a blanket of snow on his lofty
crest and by god I feel like sliding down it. Thankfully we are in luck - we can
catch a ride to the top of the mountain - but it won't be on a chairlift. Or a
T-bar. Or a rope tow.

No sir, we're going to ride a tram up the *inside* of the mountain.

In 1953 Telemark County authorities announced plans for a tunnel tramway to
ferry tourists to GTop's heavenly summit for sightseeing and to cater to the
ever growing popularity of alpine skiing. The project was initially planned as a
joint venture between local municipalities, who were eager to capitalize on
increased tourism and NATO, who was looking to establish a monitoring and
communications center to keep tabs on the Soviets. However, as you can imagine,
the operation was quickly subsumed by the military brass at NATO, shouldering
their way to sole ownership and leaving the public in the lurch.

For nearly 60 years the GTop tram was closed to the public, available only to
military personnel and civilians with the highest security clearance. Finally,
on 31-July 2010, the first tourists were allowed to ride the tram, fulfilling a
dream decades in the making.

The tram lumbers a half a mile horizontally into the mountain,
at which point we disembark and squeeze ourselves and all our gear into a
funicular railway car with 4 of our new best friends. Claustrophobics not
welcome. The funicular climbs a 39 degree grade 3/4 of a mile to the top of the
mountain where we unfold ourselves from our temporary pretzelation.


After At the top we soak in the magnificent views with a couple Aass Lite lagers we
packed for the occasion.

As we walk over to the NE cornice for a
better view Sondre finds a soggy bit of snow and sinks up to his thigh. I make
him wait to free his hoof before I snap a photo because it's just plain silly.

But what I really came over here for was an amateur digital photo of the
breathtaking scenery of Telemark County. According to 
<a href="https://www.westcoastpeaks.com/Peaks/gaustatoppen.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">westcoastpeaks.com</a>,
our vantage point offers a view of 50,000 square km (19,300 square miles),
nearly 1/6th of Norway's entire mainland. The amount of
god's green & white earth within our purview at this moment exceeds the entire
landed area within the states of Maryland, Hawaii, and Massachusetts, and more
than *doubles* the areas of Vermont, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Connecticut,
Delaware, and Rhode Island. You could see a quarter of Oklahoma from up here.
This must be what a tornado feels like.

Once we've had our fill of the views and the Aass I strap on my (Sondre's
brother's) gear and point my (Sondre's brother's) skis downhill.

The boots don't fit

The skis feel weird

The snow is sloppy

*It's marvelous*

It's skiing... In May... In Norway...

There is nobody on the planet who is having a better time than I right now.

Seeing as I have nearly zero proficiency when it comes to the Norwegian
language, but I have to imagine that the word "Gaustatoppen," when viewed from
my current vantage point, must translate to "Larry David's cranium." I'm
currently standing atop a completely bald dome ringed by wispy flecks of foliage.
