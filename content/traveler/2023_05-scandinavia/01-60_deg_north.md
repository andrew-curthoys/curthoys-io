<h4 class="article-subheader">Who's Ready For Some Waiting Sausages?</h4>
This is a travel story, sure.

But this is about much, much more.

This is a story about cuisine. This is a story about creativity. This is a story
about culture.

This...

This is a story about the deep, undying love Norwegians hold for hot dogs.

In the US we have the turn dog, we have the 4th of July frank, we have the
ballpark dog. But the *waiting sausage* is a level of hot dog innovation that
only the culinary minds of the Norseland could conjure.

Yes, the humble tubesteak holds a place of loving affection in the hearts of
Norwegians from Stavanger to Svalbard. It's truly remarkable to see the extent
to which a nation will unanimously rally around a grilled frankfurter.

If you ask any Norwegian if they've ever heard of "waiting sausages" they'll look
at you like you've asked if they've ever heard of Santa Claus (who hails from
the town of Dr&oslash;bek just outside of Oslo by the way).

The waiting sausage is a proud Norwegian tradition that occurs any time an open
flame licks the underside of a grill grate. While the main course is cooking,
the grillmaster will throw a couple dogs on the fire to serve as a Nordic
hors d'&oelig;uvre. A dog while you wait, behold the waiting sausage.

Norwegians take the hot dog innovation one step further and dispense with the
dry, protuberant hot dog bun and wrap their dogs in *lompe*, a traditional thin
potato pancake that resembles a tortilla. Atop the dog comes ketchup, mustard,
and crispy onions. After my first *p&oslash;lse med lompe* I have to say that
we are doing hot dogs all wrong in the States. As the progenitors of the modern
hot dog, we've gotten complacent and allowed Norway to surpass us in
frankfurter technology.

Throughout his reign Alexander the Great folded foreign customs into the society
of his empire. I'm not one to claim I'm better than Alexander the Great so as
Andrew the Alright I
will follow his lead and take the waitings sausages and *lompe* hot dog blanket
back to the States. I have a feeling I'm going to
be the most popular person at my next BBQ.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Oh Shit or: How I Learned to Stop Adulting and
Lose My Phone</h4>
I'm halfway up the up escalator at RDU airport when I realize I've
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/12-rockies_pt2?id=phone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">done it again</a>.
I've dispossessed myself of my phone out of pure stupidity. I quickly about face
and sprint back down the up escalator in the hopes that Dani hasn't driven away yet.

Dani is a friend from my apartment who agreed to drive me to the airport in
exchange for using my car while I'm gone. Dani is a friend from my apartment
who is sprinting into the terminal with my phone.

I see her just as I bound through one set of sliding doors & she through another,
headed in opposite directions. She's halfway to the escalator before she hears
my shouts echo through the terminal. She turns around and we exchange wide eyed
looks of relief.

"You went into the terminal and your music kept playing and I was like 'damn,
your bluetooth range is great! Then looked down and saw your phone.'"

"Thank you so much Dani. I am a moron."

Catastrophe averted, my situation improves considerably when the bag drop kiosk
offers me a seat in
first class for $45. That's a damn good deal, I'll take that deal.

The flight to JFK is quick and easy, but not too quick to forego a few
Goose Island IPAs.

I drop my bags to take the 4 express train to Brooklyn Heights to meet
cousin Michael and our other cousin Brett who is visiting for the weekend. I
meet the gang on the Brooklyn Promenade overlooking lower Manhattan and my
favorite stone tower hybrid cable stayed/suspension bridge.

I meet Brett's girlfriend Cat and finally meet Michael's boyfriend Shane, who I
have just missed on my last couple trips to the city. We stroll along the
promenade then duck into ______ for a round of cocktails. I order up a
Reykjavik 101, which seems like the most Viking of all the cocktails. The star
of the cocktail is Aquavit, a Scandinavian neutral-grain or potato based liquor
often flavored with caraway seeds.

After we finish our drinks an unspoken conversation occurs with a few weary
looks between my compadres that says *are you tired as shit too? good.* Shane
has work in the morning so he & Michael dip out while the three remaining
engineers talk shop. We flag the bartender down to pay our tabs & he informs us
that Shane payed for everybody. What a fuckin' guy. You're a good lad in my
book.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Manhattan Moseyin</h4>
The next day I catch up on some much needed sleep before packing my rucksack and
heading into Manhattan. There's a coffee shop I found called Oslo that sounds
like the most apropos establishment considering the destination on my boarding
pass for tonight's flight.

I take the A-C to Washington Square and hoof it a few blocks to Oslo only to
find a tiny storefront with a line out the door. Seeing as I planned to work
this morning we can say that's less than ideal. I continue to aimlessly ramble
until I stumble upon Hungry Ghost Coffee with ample space at the bar. I bang out
a couple hours of caffeine fueled work at the Ghost before relocating to the
Jefferson Market Library.

Completed in 1877, the High Victorian Gothic jewel serves as an ideal locale to
finish out my work week. Originally built as the Third Judicial District
Courthouse, the court adjudicated on the activities of the The Tederloin,
Manhattan's entertainment and red light district of the era. It would come as no
surprise, then, that the nation's first night court was established here.

By 1945 the court had relocated and the structure fell into
disrepair. Despite being voted as one of the top ten most beautiful buildings
in the US by a panel of architects in 1885, the slugheads down in City Hall in
the 1950s decided it was an antiquated eyesore. Thankfully a group of Greenwich
Village community leaders and residents (including E.E. Cummings) successfully
lobbied to preserve the building. In 1961 the New York Public Library agreed to
convert the building into a library, one of the first adaptive reuse projects
in the US and an early win for the historic preservation movement.

As a whimsically fun bow to wrap up the story of the library, "Ol' Jeff", the
bell atop the bell tower sat dormant for 135 years until 1996 when the bell was
restored and now Ol' Jeff rings every hour on the hour from 9 AM to 10 PM. Good
on ya Ol' Jeff.

The beautiful brick-arched basement where I stopped to use the loo, was
originally used as a holding area for prisoners on their way to court.

After wrapping up my work I strolled over to A Salt and Battery, a British fish
& chips joint, AKA a "chippy", featured on a recent episode of
<a href="https://gastropod.com/fish-chips-uncovering-the-forgotten-jewish-and-belgian-origins-of-the-iconic-british-dish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gastropod</a>.
Unfortunately the meal was unexpectedly mediocre. The chips were good and the
breading on the fish was light and crispy, but the fish as a whole was
disappointingly bland. No amount of supplemental salt & malt vinegar could
salvage the flavourless cod. Alas.

The next few hours are spent wandering around the Village, Chelsea Market, and
the High Line. I'm wandering around Hudson Yards when Brett texts me and says
that he & Cat are headed to Sir John's Bar & Grill on 33rd across from the
Empire State Building. I'm a short stroll away so I saunter down there for some
cold sodas before my flight. We down a few pints of Radeberger from
Deutschland, a delightfully crispy pilsner that I am chagrined
to have since learned that it's the favorite beer of Russian manbaby shitheel
Vlad Putin. Yikes.

Along with the suds we order a flatbread, quesadilla, and buffalo chicken
fingers. When the food arrives we look around for a hidden camera because each
offering is comedically tiny. The flatbread is a skosh larger than a half dollar,
the quesadilla was made for ants, and the chicken fingers were certainly modeled
after the fingers of that orange lady who used to be president. At least our
pints are $5.

At a quarter to 8 Brett & Cat scoot across the street for their 8 o'clock
Empire State Building appointment and I shuffle over to the 3 train back to
Mikey's. I deflate my bed, take a shower, and pack up the last of my belongings
and hail an Uber to JFK. Oslo, I'm comin' for ya.

<h4 class="article-subheader"></h4>
I arrive to the airport and quickly learn that Norse Atlantic Airlines does not
specialize in logistics. When I arrive to Terminal 7 at JFK I'm greeted by a
distended queue that wraps around a hallway and extends farther than the eye can
see. This should be fun.

About an hour:15 later I'm finally able to drop off my bags, at which point I
have the pleasure of waiting in another line. The TSA check takes around 30
minutes, making my time from car to gate just over 2 hours. By this point it's
been around 4 hours since my last beer and the buzz I was hoping to help me
sleep on the flight is slowly turning into a hangover.

I arrive at the gate just as boarding is *supposed* to be starting, but sit
around for another 45 minutes waiting on who knows what. When our flight
actually starts to board a horde of bozos form an amoebic queue for the Norse
flight to Paris out of the adjacent gate that has yet to start boarding. I'm
fully aware that I'm about to embark on a 7 hour journey that would have taken
a month just 100 years ago but something about Norse Atlantic makes people lose
any shred of modern common sense.

I finally step foot on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and gleefully plop into my exit
row seat that seems unnecessarily spacious. For this I won't complain.

I was able to check-in online but couldn't get my
boarding pass, so I

$20 and 20 minutes of impossibly smooth track later I find myself at the
Nationaltheateret train station in downtown Oslo. A far cry from the $60 and
45 minutes-to-an-hour-depending-on-traffic Uber ride I took to JFK. 


"Do you eat meat?"

"Uh... yeah"

"Alright, just checking. I mean you work for a solar energy company and look
like a hippie."

"Ok that's fair"

So Sondre whips me up a leftover burrito and a hot cup of joe. We split a beer
and the combination hits the spot.

farmor, which literally translates to "dadmom", which is a convenient way to
avoid inane questions like, "Is grandma Evy your dad's mom or your mom's mom?"

As we finish our beers on the rooftop terrace, Big Tom asks,

"Who's ready for some waiting sausages?"

I can't constrain my excitement.

Norwegians have a delightfully brilliant tradition when it comes to grilling.
As the main course is being prepared the grillmaster throws a few hot dogs on
the grill for everyone to enjoy while you're waiting for the main course. Thus,
the waiting sausage.

Norwegians also have a leg up on hot dog technology, wrapping their sausages
in *lompe*, a potato pancake.


"Are you tired?"

"I'm not sure"

built too steep - trucks have their brakes catch on fire or get stuck on the

I ordered myself a Ringnes. "Pilsner?" the bartender asks, clarifying if I
wanted the pilsner or the lite, to which I replied "si." Because I'm a moron
and my brain just went with \<any foreign language\>


In Norway they seem to have a feud with the letter "C". Whether it's the soft
c of center (*senter*) or the hard c of "coffee" (*kaffe*) there doesn't seem to
be a c they won't toss in the bin faster than a foreigner in a bunad.
