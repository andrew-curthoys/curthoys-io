Oslo as a great place to live
* Public transit
* Not many cars
* Almost all cars are electric
* Soccer match

<h4 class="article-subheader">Casually Modern</h4>
It feels strange to call the capital of a wealthy European nation *sleepy*.

My expectation of Oslo was a glinty skyscraper jungle that would feel at home
in the opening scenes of a Bond flick.

To my surprise I'm amazed at how intimate Oslo feels. With a
metropolitan population of 1.5 million, Oslo would slot 42nd in the US metro
area population rankings, between Oklahoma City and Milwaukee. Which seems
preposterous to me. While I've never really considered the population of the Oslo
Metropolitan Area, I still can't believe that it's comparable to *Oklahoma City*.

What Oklahoma City lacks in transit and density Oslo boasts in droves. At any
point you're no more than a block or two from a subway, tramway, or bus route
that can efficiently ferry you about the city. Due to its
relatively small footprint (from a quick glance at a map it seems at least
75% of the city would fit inside a 5 mile radius of the city center) it feels
like everywhere in Oslo is *20 minutes away*.


After walking around Oslo for a couple days I take in a breath of fresh air and
it hits me how polluted American cities are. The streets of Oslo are mostly
devoid of automobiles, owing to it's walkability and fabulous public transit
system. Based on a *vibes only* informal personal survey it feels like 90% of
the cars on the road are electric.


<p class="article-sub-subheader">V&aring;lerenga</p>
On Constitution Day Eve Sondre has a day of sporting lined up for me. The
beloved hometown soccer squad V&aring;lerenga is hosting the lads from
Hamarkameratene (Hamar Comrades). Often abbreviated HamKam, the Comrades hail
from Hamar, a town 80 miles to the north of Oslo on lake Mj&oslash;sa,
Norway's largest lake and also home to Lillehammer.

Before the match we meet up at a pub near the stadium with Sondre's friend
Daniel, a HamKam supporter who is, we'll say *realistic* about his team's
chances. "We suck. This is a good match for your first V&aring;lerenga game."

It's still early but HamKam has not fired out of the gates, amassing a dismal
2-4-0 record to date. However, V&aring;lerenga ain't exactly sittin' in the
catbird seat with their 2-3-1 tally.

After a few beers at the pub we set off for Intility Arena. It's about a half
hour walk through some neighborhoods, not too far from the V&aring;lerenga
Kirke (Church), the inspiration for the team's anthem. At some point in the late
70s the church burned down, inspiring Trond Ingebretsen and his band
Bj&oslash;lsen Valsem&oslash;lle to pen the song *V&aring;lerenga Kjerke*
honoring the house of worship. Supporters of V&aring;lerenga football club have
adopted the song as their defacto anthem, belting it out left, right, & center
to support the club.

I plugged the lyrics into an online translator & it feels like the gist of the
song notes that once the roof of timber burned down the church now has the sky
itself as a roof. So that's pretty hardcore.

As we approach the stadium we see a line at least 50 yards long of fans waiting
to be granted ingress to the stadium. Sondre whips out his phone and dahses off
what sounds like a few steps of making Swedish meatballs and casually walks
past the long line of antsy supporters. As we near the entrance to the stadium
a gentleman in a smart blue suit greets us behind a low wall of temporary
metal barricades.

"Hi I'm Daniel, nice to meet you!"

I look over at Daniel, then to Daniel, then back to Daniel. Reckon that's one
less name I have to remember.

Daniel escorts us past the fence & hands us a lanyard with a ticket. Daniel
is Sondre's friend and works for V&aring;lerenga in whatever official capacity
requires him to wear a blue suit to games. Whatever his job I'm thrilled to
lean into his hospitality because our tickets grant us access to the club level
beneath the home stand, the only place in the stadium where you can drink a
beer. Unlike our Stateside stadia, festooned with beer ads and vendors walking
the aisles lest you have to leave your seat for liquid refreshment, European
soccer arenas have mostly banned alcohol at games in no small part to the
advanced studies of hooliganry Europeans have amassed.

We walk past a line of people 50 yards long waiting to get into the stadium.
His other friend (also named Daniel) meets us at a

Club beers - two sausages in one lompe trick Sondre shows me.

Goal by Seedyahmed Jatta in the 18th minute, followed shortly by another by
Daniel H&aring;kans in the 24th. As halftime draws near we shuffle out to the
club for some halftime brewskis. Right as we're about to open the door to the
club we hear a roar erupt from the hometown faithful.

3-nil 'renga on a goal from Henrik Bj&oslash;rdal. Well I'll be!

The second half sees no figurative fireworks, ending the way it began, 3-0 good
guys. But it did see literal fireworks, when an opposing supporters threw an
arsenal of incendiary devices on the pitch causing a few minute delay.

What I saw seems to be a bit of a high point for V&aring;lerenga - they finished
the season in 14th place of 16, placing them in a battle for relegation against
the winner of the promotion playoff from the Norwegian First Division (which is
actually the second-tier in Norwegian soccer. Soccer amirite?)

After a home & away with Kristiansund it was all tied up, sending the
competition to penalties, which V&aring;renga lost in heartbreaking fashion 5
goals to 4. So next year the lads will be slugging it out in the First Division
with hopes to be promoted back up with the big dogs.

A last little denoument for this story, as I was doing some light research
about the club I was delighted to see that a club legend on the pitch as well
as a former manager is cognominated Leif Eriksen.

Happy Leif Eriksen Day! Hinga Dinga Dargen!


<h4 class="article-subheader">Livin' on Tulsa Time</h4>
"You're going to Oslo? You know Andy Mac lives there right?"

"Wait.... what?? Like *Andy Mac* Andy Mac?"

"Yeah, THE Andy Mac lives in Oslo, been there a few years I think"

"Well I'll be damned"

And that's how I found myself seated next to this jabroney 4,500 miles from
Father Hamill Field.

We met up for supper & a beer at Oslo Street Food food hall, our party staving
off a ravenous hunger from the day's Nordic Cycle. We catch up over a couple
teriyaki rice bowls and &Aring;ss lagers, my compadre filling me in on his
journey to the land of the Norse.

I try to keep up with the barrister banter between Will & Andy Mac, lobbing a
few precisely timed *Point of Parliamentary Procedure*!! shouts into the
transript to the chagrin of noone I'm sure.

A few more &oslash;s & a handful of stories later finds us at Crow Bar, a 
craft beer hall and brewery a snowball's throw from the food hall.


<h4 class="article-subheader">"Your accent, where's it from?"</h4>

"I'm Australian, originally from Melbourne"

"No way! My cousin lives in Perth! Beautiful country. How the hell did you end
up all the way up here??"

And that's how I met Talor Browne, the owner of
<a href="https://talormade.no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talormade</a>,
a neon obeliscolychny attracting Oslofolk far and wide with its irresistible
good vibes, outstanding coffee, and mouthwatering doughnuts. Asked
how the heck she ended up 10,000 miles from home on the other side of the world,
she briefly regales her quest to find the perfect cup of coffee.

Originally departing the land of Oz for a Parisian cafe in the early 2010s,
Talor happened to meet Tim Wendelboe, a goliath in the world of specialty coffee.
This chance encounter led to Talor working her way up to head roaster in Timmy W's
outfit. After slingin' beans with the 'boe she got a hankerin' to set off on
her own. After a few years of hosting wildly popular doughnut pop-ups (oh yeah, 
she's a trained pastry chef, nbd) and running her own roastery, Talor opened her
first brick-and-mortar location of Talormade in February 2020.

And that's exactly where I'm standing right now, eager to slam my first proper
flat white since 2019, "well seeing as you hail from down under I'm
gonna have to order a flat white"

"Great idea!"

As I take a seat on a plush purple couch Talor calls out over the din of the
espresso machine, "hey, have you ever had a cappuccino al freddo?"

"Never even heard of such a thing"

"Well it just feels like a cappuccino al freddo type of day & I'm going to make
myself one, would you like to try one?"

"Damn right I would!"

Talor fills me in on the cap al fred - originating in the Greek islands, this
cold coffee drink involves dolloping cold, extremely frothy milk over a couple
shots of iced espresso and topping it with a dash of cocoa powder. I don't
know where in that process Talor imbued witchcraft because I pick up the glass
and can't believe how light it is. *Is this glass filled with air??? What is
happening???* I take a sip and my brain further spirals into a meltdown of
incomprehension. This drink is *impossibly* smooth.
