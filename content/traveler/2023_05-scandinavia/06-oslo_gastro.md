<p class="article-sub-subheader">"Your accent, where's it from?"</p>

"I'm Australian, originally from Melbourne"

"No way! I love Australia, I have a cousin in Perth!"

And that's how I met Talor Browne, the owner of
<a href="https://talormade.no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talormade</a>,
a neon obeliscolychny attracting Oslofolk far and wide with its irresistible
good vibes, outstanding coffee, and mouthwatering doughnuts. Asked
how the heck she ended up 10,000 miles from home on the other side of the world,
she briefly regales her quest to find the perfect cup of coffee.

Originally departing the land of Oz for a Parisian cafe in the early 2010s,
Talor happened to meet Tim Wendelboe, a goliath in the world of specialty coffee.
This chance encounter led to Talor working her way up to head roaster in Timmy W's
outfit. After slingin' beans with the 'boe she got a hankerin' to set off on
her own. After a few years of hosting wildly popular doughnut pop-ups (oh yeah, 
she's a trained pastry chef, nbd) and running her own roastery, Talor opened her
first brick-and-mortar location of Talormade in February 2020.

And that's exactly where I'm standing right now, eager to slam my first proper
flat white since 2019, "well seeing as you hail from down under I'm
gonna have to order a flat white"

"Great idea!"

As I take a seat on a plush purple couch Talor calls out over the din of the
espresso machine, "hey, have you ever had a cappuccino al freddo?"

"I have no idea what that is"

"Well it just feels like a cappuccino al freddo day & I'm going to make myself
one, would you like to try one?"

"Damn right I would!"

Talor fills me in on the cap al fred - originating in the Greek islands, this
cold coffee drink involves dolloping cold, extremely frothy milk over a couple
shots of iced espresso and topping it with a dash of cocoa powder. I don't
know where in that process Talor imbued witchcraft because I pick up the glass
and can't believe how light it is. *Is this glass filled with air??? What is
happening???* I take a sip and my brain further spirals into a meltdown of
incomprehension, this drink is *impossibly* smooth.

<p class="article-sub-subheader">Bar Lorry</p>
Ordered myself a G&T with Icelandic Eagle Gin, which was presented in a
splendid goblet and a glass bottle of tonic to adulterate as I see fit. The
sharp elixir perfectly complements the vibe of the Lorry, which I would best
describe as eclectic sophistication.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">That's how you present a cocktail!</figcaption>
</figure>

The bar/restaurant dates back to the 1870s and has been a favorite hangout for
notable Oslo writers, artists, intellectuals, and all-around rabble-rousers
throughout its history. Often
tortured artists would use their work they crafted while toiling in the booths
of the Lorry as currency for food & drinks. Many of these works are still
hanging on the walls!

With our cocktails in tow, Sondre, Nora, & I peruse the incredible assortment of
art and tchotchkes on display throughout the building. As described on Lorry's
website, *Lorry is known for its extraordinary and eclectic art collection,
carefully collected from all over the World through the years. Our walls are
decorated with 207 art works by over 70 artists.*

As we wander around the main dining area we marvel at the artwork, the
knick-knacks, the figurines, the zebra head, the display of dozens of
corkscrews, the model ships, the old beer bottles. Once again from their website,
*you are guaranteed surprises and absurdities everywhere you look. A visit to
Lorry will be remembered for a long time.*

I couldn't agree more. And the most unforgettable part of the entire bazaar is
the taxidermied giraffe wearing a bowtie at the top of the stairs.

<p class="article-sub-subheader">Izakaya</p>
One afternoon we're wandering around the Barcode when Nora exclaims, "Oh my
friend works at Vin Bj&oslash;rvika, let's see if she's working!"

So we make a quick ambulatory right turn and saunter up to a wine bar situated
on a promenade overlooking the fjord. Unfortunately Nora's friend is not on
shift but we circle up 'round a table on the promenade nonetheless.

I order a *Solitude Gigondas 2020* from the Rh&ocirc;ne Valley, a full-bodied
red blend of 70% Grenache, 20% Syrah, & 10% Cinsault, if for no other reason
than I've heard people who like wine say things about Cinsault. Can I remember
if they were good things about Cinsault or bad things about Cinsault? No. Will
I be able to taste the difference? Also no.

We pair our vin with a assortment of charcuterie presented as a three-story
tower of epicurean delicacies that perfectly accentuates our waterfront vibes
on this beautiful afternoon.

As we graze each delectable morsel of charcuterie steadily swells our hunger.
Each swig of wine sharpens our focus.

A plan for supper coalesces.

And just like that the Norwegian gastro gang is off on their next adventure,
cruising across town on rented scooters, weaving through historic Oslo
neighborhoods. The streets are mostly devoid of automobile traffic, creating a
feeling of safety that you'd be hard pressed to find in any US city. The few
cars that do occupy the streets, lanes, and avenues of Olso navigate the
thoroughfares at a reasonable pace, deferring to pedestrians, cyclists,
scooter-ers, and other non-car methods of transport. It's a wholly relaxing
urban milieu.

Soon our roving band of heathens arrives to Izakaya, a nondescript Japanese
restaurant occupying the garden floor of a residential building steps away
from a traffic circle featuring the Lysfonene, i.e. fountain of light.

</figure>

I have to stoop as we step down to the entrance of the restaurant, a doorway
not befitting the Viking bloodlines of its denizens. The low ceilings and
modest confines tiptoe the line between cozy and cramped. It has a feel of a
place that can only be acquired through decades of repeat customers.

The menu, in its simplicity, "Japanese dishes and Japanese alcohol."
The wooden tables, well-worn. Evidence of spilt Sapporo. Of sloppy chopsticks.
Of late nights in a half-basement where you dread leaving the warmth of your
company to bear the frigid Norwegian winter. 

I'm in love.

We find our way to one of those perfectly patina-d tables, seating myself in the
upsettingly comfortable position of "fifth wheel."

First things first. A round of Sapporos & sake.
