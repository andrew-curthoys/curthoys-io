<h4 class="article-subheader">Let's Go Sing!</h4>
"Sing?"

"Yeah my friends have a karaoke room for the next 10 minutes!"

"Oh hell yes"

My new friend Louise leads me to a private karaoke parlour stuffed to the gills
with her friends who are stuffed to the gills with booze.

The real estate is limited but we finagle a spot on a couch at
the back of the room. I do my best to join in on the songs, following along with
the Norwegian words that flash up on the screen. I jump up and down, I fist
pump, I horrifically mangle words I don't
know at the top of my lungs in unison with a few dozen of my newest friends.

Welcome to Norway Day.

Velkommen til Syttende Mai.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Champagne Breakfast</h4>
The day started the way nearly every day starts in Norway on the 17th of May,
with a champagne breakfast.

Right at 10 AM a steady stream of co-conspirators begins to arrive: Joakim,
Tobaias, Bj&oslash;rn, Thomas, Rolf, Sindre (not to be confused with Sondre) and
of course Kristoffer and Kristoffer (not to be confused with Christoffer).

Each reveler brings a separate dish in the Norway Day breakfast potluck
tradition. By the end of the
procession of dishes the table is populated with a hillock of rolls,
scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, salted cured meats, myriad cheeses, ham
rolls, salmon rolls, mango salsa, avocado, bell peppers, cucumbers, brownies,
and for some reason, chicken wings. I've eaten hundreds, maybe thousands, of
wings in my day, but this is the first time I've eaten them for breakfast.

Once the table is set, our posse of the North Oslo Mafia participates in a
champagne toast and a rousing
rendition of "Ja, vi elsker", the Norwegian national anthem. Penned by the
delightfully cognominated Bj&oslash;rnstjerne Bj&oslash;rnson, the song wasn't
officially adopted as the National
Anthem until 11 December 2019 after serving 100-some-odd years as the *de facto*
anthem. Translated as "Yes, we love this country", ol Bj&oslash;rnstjerne spent
nearly 10 years spinning this intricate and complex patriotic metaphor. As a
further testament to Bj&oslash;rnstjerne's creativity he named his first born
Bj&oslash;rn Bj&oslash;rnson.

I jest but Uncle Bj&oslash;rnstjerne holds the honorable disctinction of being
Norway's first Nobel Laureate so I reckon he's got the last laugh.

After the toast everyone fills their plate and finds whatever couch, chair,
bench, ledge, armrest, or other ass-cheek sized horizontal surface 2-3 feet off
the ground that's available to accommodate a dozen peak efficiency cultivators
of mass in a 1 bedroom downtown Oslo apartment.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Syttende Mai</h4>
Every year the entire nation of Norway shuts down two days after the
Ides of May in a massive celebration. It goes by many names, *Syttende Mai*
(17th of May), *Nasjonaldagen* (National Day), *Grunnlosdagen* (Constitution
Day), or when you're talking to a Yank, "Norway Day".

The day traces its roots back to the Constitution of Norway, signed on the 17th
of May 1814 in the town of Eidsvoll 70 km to the Northeast of Oslo. The
constitution declared Norway to be an independent kingdom to avoid being given
to Sweden by Denmark. **And then was given to Sweden anyways??**


One of the hallmarks of Constitution Day is the absence of military parades or
displays. This is a conscious decision to dedicate the day to the people of
Norway and not a jingoistic display of military might.

It's the second oldest working national constitution in the world after the US
Constitution, which of course took effect on the 4th of March 1789. Everybody
in the US knows that, right?

"Children in particular relish Constitution Day as they are generally given carte blanche to eat as much ice cream and as many waffles, cakes and hot dogs as they like, hang the consequences.

The day was first celebrated by students post-1814 but was banned outright between 1820 and 1829 under orders from King Karl Johan of Sweden while the two neighbours were united.

It became an established tradition in 1833 when poet Henrik Wergeland gave a public speech honouring Norwegian heritage beneath a monument to reformist government minister Christian Krohg.

Constitution Day’s close association with children began in 1864 when author
Bjornstjerne Bjornson, who wrote the national anthem, suggested staging a parade
just for primary school pupils, representing Norway’s bright future."

<h4 class="article-subheader">Suit Up</h4>
One of the most striking differences between the Norwegian & US American
Independence Day celebrations is sartorial.

In the US, a common 4th of July outfit would be jean shorts and a cutoff
American flag t-shirt. I would know from experience.

Norwegians take a different tact. Instead of "suns out guns out" they abide by
the policy of "we don't see the sun for 4 months out of the year, let's wear
suits."

One day while milling around the apartment Sondre casually asks me,

"Do you want me to steam your suit for the 17th of May?"

"My what?"

"Your suit for the 17th"

"I need a suit?"

"Yeah you need a suit!"

"Why didn't you tell me this before I crossed an ocean without a suit?"

"I thought you said you had a suit for the wedding"

"I said I have a tuxedo for the wedding and and based on the debauchery you've
reported about the 17th there's no way I'd wear *anything*
that I planned to wear to the wedding."

"That's ok we can get you a suit, there are plenty of places to shop around
here"

So that's how my overstuffed suitcase got more stuffed and my emaciated
wallet got more emaciated.

Thankfully I found a store called Dressman where I was able to acquire a
light blue suit and paisley button down shirt for $200. Much better than the
$2000 suits I found in the first place I strolled past in the mall.

When I picked out the paisley shirt the salesman tried to stifle a grimace,

"Are you sure you don't want a white shirt?"

"I have so many white shirts, I don't need another"

"Do you have a white shirt in Norway?"

"What's your return policy?"

"Not after the 17th"

"I'll take the paisley"

When I meet back up with Sondre at his office I show him and his coworkers my
suit, which is widely approved, then the paisley shirt, which causes some
uneasy half-smiles. Sondre pipes up,

"You didn't get a white shirt?"

"No I don't need any more white shirts!"

His coworkers look at each other & gather a modicum of gumption,

"Yeah we think you should get a white shirt"

"I'm not getting a white shirt"

"Are you sure?"

"If Sondre would have told me to bring a suit I would have a white shirt, now
the more you tell me I need a white shirt the less I want to wear a white shirt"

"Ok, we still think you should get a white sh.."

And this is when my noise cancelling headphones go on.



I enjoy a few glasses of champagne over breakfast before switching to beer.

Yesterday I scooped up a selection of &oslash;l from the grocer below Sondre's
apartment. Among the offerings are the VestKyst IPA from Kinn Bryggeri,
Littlebro Session IPA & Czech-Style Pils from &AElig;gir Bryggeri, Fjord
Session IPA from Tya Bryggeri, the Pale Ale & Brown Ale from N&oslash;gne
&Oslash; plus a few Frydenlund Pales Ale just to be on the safe side.

As I crack into one of the IPAs, Tobias inquires,

"What kind of beer is that?"

"The IPA from &AElig;gir, it's really good, you want to try it?"

"Oh no, I don't like *eepas*"

"See that's where we're different, Tobias, I love *eepas*"

We continue drinking our &Oslash;, *eepas*, and champagne whilst milling about
in Sondre's apartment and jockeying for a good spot on the balcony to soak in
the fabulous weather.

When Sondre's hooligan friends begin to pile into his apartment, one fella in
particular stood out. Christoffer strolls in decked out in a full *bunad*.
After an hour or two the party moves to the rooftop terrace, where Sondre &
friends introduce me to King of the Court, their simple yet deceptively fun
ball & paddle game. The paddles are essentially oversized ping pong paddles and
the ball is like a smaller, less dense lacrosse ball. The game pits the King
vs a challenger, who must score two points against the King to take his crown.
The King must only score a single point to send his lowly peon subject to the
gallows and bring on fresh blood. It's blindingly simple, unexpectedly fun, and
cycles through players quickly so everyone gets to play without a bunch of
standing around.

While on the roof Christoffer rocked a skateboard in a full bunad.

"I love skating! Skate 4 lyfe!!!!"

*Rolls across the roof about 10 feet, jumps off the skateboard without it
following him, returns to another part of the skateboard and almost falls on his
ass.*

While on the roof, a couple of Sondre's friends from another apartment whose
names went in one ear, sailed the high seas of beer and champagne sloshing
around my head and marooned on my other earlobe. They come bearing gifts, most
importantly a large pitcher of sangria. And if you're reading this you likely
know that Uncle Andy looooooooooooves sangria wine!

<h4 class="article-subheader">This is Where The Parade Ended</h4>
"Wait.... what parade?"

"Did Sondre not take you to the parade?"

"This is the first I'm hearing of it"

"Sondre! You didn't take him to the parade!?"

"I took him to MY version of Constitution Day, if you wanted to show him the
parade you shouldn't have gone to Spain!"

"Did you at least have some ice cream?"

"Nope"

"Sondre!"

Sondre's girlfriend Nora is (rightfully) incensed that I did not attend the
parade while indulging in mountains of ice cream. *2 scoops? Make it 3, I'm not
driving*. But to be fair she did leave the country
the week of the 17th, which should be a crime in my opinion.

<div class="tenor-gif-embed mb-3" data-postid="24460693" data-share-method="host" data-aspect-ratio="1.77778" data-width="100%"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/jail-no-excuse-gif-24460693">Jail No GIF</a>from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/jail-gifs">Jail GIFs</a></div> <script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>

The parade is one of the most beloved traditions of Constitution Day. All over
the country, children assemble with their elementary schools to participate in
the parade. Each school carries their official school banner and is typically
accompanied by the school's marching band. The Oslo parade attracts over
100,000 people to watch 100+ schools parade through town, waving Norwegian
flags. The final stop of the parade is the Royal Palace, where the children
pass by the Royal Family who display the
*R&oslash;j&aelig;lw&aring;v&oslash;kk&aelig;r*\*, the official Royal Wave

\*I just made that word up

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">R&oslash;j&aelig;lw&aring;v&oslash;kk&aelig;r!</figcaption>
</figure>

We're currently standing in front of the Royal Palace, looking down upon the
final stretch of the parade route. The most remarkable thing that I notice is
the complete lack of evidence that tens of thousands of Norwegians of various
states of drunkenness occupied this exact same spot just two days ago. No litter,
no vandalism, no evidence of hooliganry. The only evidence I saw in the days
following the 17th was a newspaper vending box wearing three empty beer bottles
as a crown. That's it. The Norwegians know how to party but they also know how
to leave it like ya found it.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Ok Let's Go to the Bar!</h4>
After our rooftop carousing the decision is made among the committee to transfer
the festivities to the bar. As anyone who has tried to herd a dozen half drunk
men, this takes at least two beers worth of time. Eventually we hop on the
trolley right outside Sondre's apartment and head to Syng, a bar overlooking the
mighty Akerselva with private karaoke rooms.

Walking down towards the patio I see a few dozen patrons in bunader reveling in
the beautiful May weather.


I also got a bow tie

Don't wear the bow tie

I'll bring it just in case

So I put it in my pocket like a pocket square

A young woman who seemingly decided that the 17 in the 17th of May was the
number of drinks she needed to drink that day 

What's that

Oh it's a bow tie

Can I see?

And before I could say anything she reaches across the table & swipes it from
my pocket

I watch her fumble around with the strap & clasp before she capitulates and
asks for my assistance

I adjust the strap to fit around a non-collared neck and help her put it on


SNUS
The most common refrain I heard regarding snus was "it's like tobacco but it's
not bad for you!" I'm sure my good friend Pete, the Dippin' Dentist &trade; would
support this spurious claim.


I'm picking on Sondre, yes. But that's what you do with your brothers. I tease
because I love. And now that I've teased I have to praise. Sondre has turned
into a fine young man. He's the Head of Sales at Orbit, a company that manages shared
workspaces around
the Oslo area (think WeWork but not a scam). Which works out great for me
because he has a handful of meetings the Monday & Tuesday before Wednesday the
17th, so I can utilize one of the desks to bang out a couple of days of work.

At the bar Joakim gifts me his 3 presidents lapel pin

I met Louise outside on the patio overlooking the Akerselva with a line
that's so stupid it just might work,

"Hey I'm American, what's your name?"

Well, to be accurate, this Cassanovian communiqu&eacute; was delivered to
Louise's friend Martine.

So while I'm chatting with Martine, Louise sidles up to let me know I'm
barking up the wrong tree.

"Just to let you know, that's Martine's girlfriend right over there"

I glance across the bar to a stunning Norwegian beauty in an elaborate
form-fitting bunad. Yeah I can't blame Martine there, a significant upgrade
from the mountain troll in front of you.

Typically in a conversation the other party replies to the first but I just sat
and stared mouth agape. Louise breaks the silence,

"Hey, let's go sing!"

So we sang.

*bunad*, the traditional Norwegian folk costume
that's commonly worn on Norway Day. While the modern bunad is a
20th century invention meant to invoke traditions of the past, it still takes
inspiration from outfits worn by Norwegians as far back as the 18th century.
Every bunad is different, but they typically consist of elaborate embroidery,
scarves, shawls, stockings, and handmade jewelry known as s&oslash;lje. Most
s&oslash;lje are made of silver, a material that's steeped in Norwegian lore.
Legend has it that the silver mines belonged to the mountain trolls & the
wearer of silver would be protected against sickness, rotten weather, and bad
luck.

A bunad should reflect the family or regional heritage of the wearer. It serves
as an homage to your heritage.
