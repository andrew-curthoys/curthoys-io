<h4 class="article-subheader">Let's Go Sing!</h4>
My new friend Louise leads me to a karaoke room filled to the brim with her
friends who are filled to the brim with ethyl alcohol.

I met Louise outside on the patio overlooking the river with a line that's so
stupid it just might work,

"Hey I'm American, what's your name?"

Well, to be accurate, this suave line was delivered to Louise's friend Martine,
after which I complimented her *bunad*, the traditional Norwegian folk costume
that's commonly worn on Norway Day. While the modern bunad is a
20th century invention meant to invoke traditions of the past, it still takes
inspiration from outfits worn by Norwegians as far back as the 18th century.
Every bunad is different, but they typically consist of elaborate embroidery,
scarves, shawls, stockings, and handmade jewelry known as s&oslash;lje. Most
s&oslash;lje are made of silver, a material that's steeped in Norwegian lore.
Legend has it that the silver mines belonged to the mountain trolls & the
wearer of silver would be protected against sickness, rotten weather, and bad
luck.

A bunad should reflect the family or regional heritage of the wearer. It serves
as an homage to your heritage.

So while I'm chatting with Martine, Louise sidles up to let me know I'm
barking up the wrong tree.

"Just to let you know, that's Martine's girlfriend right over there"

I glance across the bar to a stunning Norwegian beauty in an elaborate
form-fitting bunad. Yeah I can't blame Martine there, a significant upgrade
from the mountain troll in front of you.

Typically in a conversation the other party replies to the first but I just sat
and stared mouth agape. Louise breaks the silence,

"Hey, let's go sing!"

"Sing?"

"Yeah my friends have a karaoke room for the next 10 minutes, let's go!"

"I'm in!"

There's not a lot of real estate to be had but we finagle a spot on a couch at
the back of the room. I do my best to join in on the songs, following along with
my horrific pronunciations of the Norwegian words that flash up on the screen.
I jump up and down, I fist pump, I scream words I don't know in unison with a
couple dozen of my newest friends in bundader.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Champagne Breakfast</h4>
The day started the way nearly every day starts in Norway on the 17th of May,
with a champagne breakfast.

Bread, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, salted cured meats, multiple cheeses, ham
rolls, salmon rolls, mango salsa, avocado, bell peppers, cucumbers, brownies,
and for some reason, chicken wings. I've eaten hundreds, maybe thousands, of
wings in my day, but this is the first time I've eaten them for breakfast.

Once the food is tabled, the crew participates in a champagne toast 


<h4 class="article-subheader">This is Where The Parade Came</h4>
"Wait.... what parade?"

"Did Sondre not take you to the parade?"

"This is the first I'm hearing of it"

"Sondre! You didn't take him to the parade!?"

"I took him to MY version of Constitution Day, if you wanted to show him the
parade you shouldn't have gone to Spain!"

"Did you at least have some ice cream?"

"Nope"

"Sondre!"

Sondre's girlfriend Nora is (rightfully) incensed that I did not see the parade
nor ate mountains of ice cream. But to be fair she did leave the country the
week of the 17th, which should be a crime in my opinion.

<div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="24460693" data-share-method="host" data-aspect-ratio="1.77778" data-width="100%"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/jail-no-excuse-gif-24460693">Jail No GIF</a>from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/jail-gifs">Jail GIFs</a></div> <script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>

Don't do parade, don't eat ice cream

<h4 class="article-subheader">Suit Up</h4>
One major difference between the US American Independence Day and Norwegian
Independence Day is sartorial.

In the US, a common 4th of July outfit would be jean shorts and a cutoff
American flag t-shirt. I would know from experience.

Norwegians take a different tact. Instead of "suns out guns out" they abide by
the policy of "we don't see the sun for 4 months out of the year let's wear
suits."

"Do you have a suit for the 17th of May?"

"What?"

"You need a suit for the 17th"

"Why didn't you tell me this before I crossed an ocean?"

"I thought you said you had a suit for the wedding"

"I said I have a tuxedo for the wedding and there's no way I'd wear *anything*
that I planned to wear to the wedding for Norway Day based on the debauchery
you've reported."

"That's ok we can get you a suit, there are plenty of places to shop around
here"

So that's how my overstuffed suitcase got more stuffed and my emaciated
wallet got lighter.

Thankfully I found a store called Dressman where I was able to acquire a
light blue suit and paisley button down shirt for $200. Much better than the
$2000 suits I found in the first place I strolled past in the mall.

"Are you sure you don't want a white shirt?"

"I have so many white shirts, I don't need another"

"Do you have a white shirt in Norway?"

"What's your return policy?"

"Not after the 17th"

"Give me the paisley"


We spent an amount of time that would only make sense to a male

King of the Court.

It's brilliant.

The king gets two outs, the challenger gets one.


I also got a bow tie

Don't wear the bow tie

I'll bring it just in case

So I put it in my pocket like a pocket square

A young woman who seemingly decided that the 17 in the 17th of May was the
number of drinks she needed to drink that day 

What's that

Oh it's a bow tie

Can I see?

And before I could say anything she reaches across the table & swipes it from
my pocket

I watch her fumble around with the strap & clasp before she capitulates and
asks for my assistance

I adjust the strap to fit around a non-collared neck and help her put it on


SNUS
The most common refrain I heard regarding snus was "it's like tobacco but it's
not bad for you!" I'm sure my good friend Pete, the Dippin' Dentist &trade; would
support this spurious claim.


I'm picking on Sondre, yes. But that's what you do with your brothers. I tease
because I love. And now that I've teased I have to praise. Sondre has turned
into a fine young man.

He's the Head of Sales at Orbit, a company that manages shared workspaces around
the Oslo area (think WeWork but not a scam). Which works out great for me
because he has a handful of meetings the Monday & Tuesday before Wednesday the
17th, so I can utilize one of the desks to bang out a couple of days of work.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Syttende Mai</h4>
Every year the entire nation of Norway shuts down two days subsequent to the
Ides of May in a massive celebration. It goes by many names, *Syttende Mai*
(17th of May), *Nasjonaldagen* (National Day), *Grunnlosdagen* (Constitution
Day), or simply "Norway Day".

The day traces its roots back to the Constitution of Norway, signed 


One of the hallmarks of Constitution Day is the absence of military parades or
displays. This is a conscious decision to dedicate the day to the people of
Norway and not a jingoistic display of military might.

It's the second oldest working national constitution in the world after the US
Constitution, which of course took effect on the 4th of March 1789. 

"Children in particular relish Constitution Day as they are generally given carte blanche to eat as much ice cream and as many waffles, cakes and hot dogs as they like, hang the consequences.

The day was first celebrated by students post-1814 but was banned outright between 1820 and 1829 under orders from King Karl Johan of Sweden while the two neighbours were united.

It became an established tradition in 1833 when poet Henrik Wergeland gave a public speech honouring Norwegian heritage beneath a monument to reformist government minister Christian Krohg.

Constitution Day’s close association with children began in 1864 when author
Bjornstjerne Bjornson, who wrote the national anthem, suggested staging a parade
just for primary school pupils, representing Norway’s bright future."
