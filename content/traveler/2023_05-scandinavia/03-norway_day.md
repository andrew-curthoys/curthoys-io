<h4 class="article-subheader">Let's Go Sing!</h4>
Louise leads me to a karaoke room filled to the brim with her friends who are
filled to the brim with ethyl alcohol.

I met Louise outside on the patio overlooking the river with my pickup line I've
been working on,

"Hey I'm American, what's your name?"



<h4 class="article-subheader">Champagne Breakfast</h4>
The day started the way nearly every day starts in Norway on the 17th of May,
with a champagne breakfast.
