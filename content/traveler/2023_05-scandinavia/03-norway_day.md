<h4 class="article-subheader">Let's Go Sing!</h4>
"Sing?"

"Yeah my friends have a karaoke room for the next 10 minutes!"

"Oh well... yeah... Let's go sing!"

And just like that my new friend Louise leads me to a private karaoke parlour
stuffed to the gills with her friends who are stuffed to the gills with ethyl
alcohol.

The real estate is limited but we finagle a spot on a couch at
the back of the room. I do my best to join in on the songs, following along with
the Norwegian words that flash up on the screen. I jump up and down, I fist
pump, I horrifically mangle words I don't
know at the top of my lungs in unison with a few dozen of my newest friends.

Welcome to Norway Day.

Velkommen til Syttende Mai.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Champagne Breakfast</h4>
The day started the way nearly every day starts in Norway on the 17th of May,
with a champagne breakfast.

Right at 10 AM a steady stream of co-conspirators begin to arrive to Sondre's
apartment: Joakim,
Tobias, Bj&oslash;rn, Thomas, Rolf, Sindre (not to be confused with Sondre) and
of course Kristoffer and Kristoffer (not to be confused with Christoffer).

Each reveler brings a separate dish in the Norway Day breakfast potluck
tradition. By the end of the
procession of dishes the table is populated with a hillock of rolls,
scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, salted cured meats, myriad cheeses, ham
rolls, salmon rolls, mango salsa, avocado, bell peppers, cucumbers, brownies,
and for some reason, chicken wings. I've eaten hundreds, maybe thousands, of
wings in my day, but this is the first time I've eaten them for breakfast.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">That's how you start your damn day!</figcaption>
</figure>

Once the table is set, our posse of the North Oslo Mafia participates in a
champagne toast and a rousing
rendition of "Ja, vi elsker", the Norwegian national anthem. Penned by the
delightfully cognominated Bj&oslash;rnstjerne Bj&oslash;rnson, the song wasn't
officially adopted as the National
Anthem until 11-December 2019 after serving 100-some-odd years as the *de facto*
anthem. Translated as "Yes, we love this country", ol Bj&oslash;rnstjerne spent
nearly 10 years spinning this intricate and complex patriotic metaphor. As a
further testament to Bj&oslash;rnstjerne's creativity he named his first born
Bj&oslash;rn Bj&oslash;rnson.

I jest but Uncle Bj&oslash;rnstjerne holds the honorable disctinction of being
Norway's first Nobel Laureate so I reckon he's got the last laugh.

After the toast everyone fills their plate and finds whatever couch, chair,
bench, ledge, armrest, or other ass-cheek sized horizontal surface 2-3 feet off
the ground that's available to accommodate a dozen peak efficiency cultivators
of mass in a 1 bedroom downtown Oslo apartment.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Syttende Mai</h4>
Every year the entire nation of Norway shuts down in the shadow of the
Ides of May for a massive celebration. It goes by many names, *Syttende Mai*
(17th of May), *Nasjonaldagen* (National Day), *Grunnlosdagen* (Constitution
Day), or when you're talking to a Yank, "Norway Day".

The celebration traces its roots to the signing of the Constitution of Norway
on the 17th of May 1814 in the town of Eidsvoll 70 km to the Northeast of Oslo.
The constitution declared Norway to be an independent kingdom after Sweden's
defeat of Denmark (who were the rulers of Norway) during the Napoleonic Wars.
Being ruled by Denmark is one thing but any self respecting Norwegian would
rather give up hot dogs than willfully accept Swedish overlords. So they went to
war.

But to say they went to war would be the equivalent of saying the Titanic went to
sea. It happened, sure, but the paint was barely dry before it was all over.
All in all the conflict lasted about 2 weeks and from what I can gather the
Norwegians lost about 400 brave men. But their sacrifice was not made in vain as
Sweden agreed to honor the Norwegian Constitution while allowing it to remain
independent-ish through a "personal union" with Sweden. So while Norway's
parliament elected Charles XII of Sweden as king of Norway in November of 1814,
The Norwegians could hold their heads high.

  in Norwegian, but seeing as I don't speak Norwegian the only thing I was able to
  glean from it was this cool photo of a dude on a horse.</figcaption>
</figure>

The Norwegian Constitution is the second oldest working national constitution in
the world after the US Constitution, which of course took effect on the 4th of
March 1789. Everybody in the US knows knows our Constitution Day just like the
Norwegians, right?

When King Karl Johan of Sweden ascended to the throne in 1818 he strictly
forbade the celebrations until he realized the Norwegian spirit shall not be
opressed and allowed the festivities starting in 1829.

One of the hallmarks of Constitution Day is the absence of military parades or
displays. This is a conscious decision to shun what many countries use as a
jingoistic display of belligerent force and to instead dedicate the day to the
people of Norway. Novel idea right?

But the real winners on Constitution Day are the children. On this glorious day
kids are permitted to eat as much ice cream, waffles, cakes, hot dogs, and any
other junk food their developing brains deem appropriate. I can't say for sure
how this tradition started but based on my observations on the day it's likely
due to all the parents getting blasted on aquavit.

But the celebration of children on Constitution Day is not merely gustatorial;
beginning in 1864 our old friend Bj&oslash;rnstjerne Bj&oslash;rnson suggested
staging a parade for children to represent Norway's bright future. Ever since 
then parades have been staged all over the country with the largest, of course,
occurring in Oslo.

<h4 class="article-subheader">This is Where The Parade Ended</h4>
"Wait.... what parade?"

"Did Sondre not take you to the parade?"

"This is the first I'm hearing of it"

"Sondre! You didn't take him to the parade!?"

"I took him to MY version of Constitution Day, if you wanted to show him the
parade you shouldn't have gone to Spain!"

"Did you at least have some ice cream?"

"Nope"

"Sondre!"

We're currently standing in front of the Royal Palace on the 19th of May,
looking down upon the final stretch of the parade route. Sondre's girlfriend
Nora is (rightfully) incensed that he did not take me to the parade and shovel
mountains of ice cream in my face. *2 scoops? Make it 3, I'm not
driving*. But to be fair she did leave the country
the week of the 17th, which should be a crime in my opinion.

<div class="tenor-gif-embed mb-3" data-postid="24460693" data-share-method="host" data-aspect-ratio="1.77778" data-width="100%"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/jail-no-excuse-gif-24460693">Jail No GIF</a>from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/jail-gifs">Jail GIFs</a></div> <script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>

The parade is one of the most beloved traditions of Constitution Day. All over
the country, children assemble with their elementary schools to participate in
the parade. Each school carries their official school banner and is typically
accompanied by the school's marching band. The Oslo parade attracts over
100,000 people to watch 100+ schools parade through town, waving Norwegian
flags. The final stop of the parade is the Royal Palace, where the children
pass by the Royal Family who display the
*R&oslash;j&aelig;lw&aring;v&oslash;kk&aelig;r*\*, the official Royal Wave

\*I just made that word up

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">R&oslash;j&aelig;lw&aring;v&oslash;kk&aelig;r!</figcaption>
</figure>

The most remarkable thing that I notice while standing on the grounds of the
Royal Palace is
the complete lack of evidence that tens of thousands of Norwegians of various
states of drunkenness occupied this exact same spot just two days ago. No litter,
no vandalism, no evidence of hooliganry. The only evidence I saw in the days
following the 17th was a newspaper vending box wearing three empty beer bottles
as a crown. That's it. The Norwegians know how to party but they also know how
to leave it like ya found it.

	right?</figcaption>

<h4 class="article-subheader">Suit Up</h4>
Perhaps the most striking difference between the Norwegian & US American
Independence Day celebrations is the sartorial stylings of the merrymakers.

In the US, a common 4th of July outfit is jean shorts and a cutoff
American flag t-shirt. I would know from experience.

Norwegians take a different tact. Instead of "suns out guns out" they abide by
the policy of "we don't see the sun for 4 months out of the year, let's wear
suits."

Which I was wholly unawares of until two days before the party Sondre casually
asks me,

"Do you want me to steam your suit for the 17th of May?"

"My what?"

"Your suit for the 17th"

"I need a suit?"

"Yeah you need a suit!"

"Why didn't you tell me this before I crossed an ocean without a suit?"

"I thought you said you had a suit for the wedding"

"I said I have a tuxedo for the wedding and and based on the debauchery you've
reported about the 17th there's no way I'd wear *anything*
that I planned to wear to the wedding."

"That's ok we can get you a suit, there are plenty of places to shop around
here"

So that's how my stuffed suitcase got overstuffed and my emaciated
wallet got overemaciated.

Thankfully I found a store called Dressman where I was able to acquire a
light blue suit and paisley button down for \$200. Much better than the
\$2000 suits I found in the first place I strolled past in the mall.

When I picked out the paisley shirt the salesman tried to stifle a grimace,

"Are you sure you don't want a white shirt?"

"I have so many white shirts, I don't need another"

"Do you have a white shirt in Norway?"

"What's your return policy?"

"Not after the 17th"

"I'll take the paisley"

When I meet back up with Sondre at his office I show him and his coworkers my
suit, which is widely approved, then the paisley shirt, which causes some
uneasy half-smiles. Sondre pipes up,

"You didn't get a white shirt?"

"No I don't need any more white shirts!"

His coworkers look at each other & gather a modicum of gumption,

"Yeah we think you should get a white shirt"

"I'm not getting a white shirt"

"Are you sure?"

"If Sondre would have told me to bring a suit I would have a white shirt, now
the more you tell me I need a white shirt the less I want to wear a white shirt"

"Ok, we still think you should get a white sh.."

And this is when my noise cancelling headphones go on.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Bunader</h4>
While a suit satisfies the *minimum pieces of flair* requirement, many partiers
choose to celebrate their Norwegian heritage with a *bunad*, the traditional
Norwegian folk costume. Each bunad is different, but they typically consist of
elaborate embroidery, scarves, shawls, belts, stockings, caps, and handmade
jewelry known as s&oslash;lje. Most
s&oslash;lje are made of silver, a material that's steeped in Norwegian lore.
Legend has it that the silver mines belonged to the mountain trolls & the
wearer of silver would be protected against sickness, rotten weather, and bad
luck.

A bunad should reflect the family or regional heritage of the wearer and
sometimes, I'm just now learning, the marital status of the wearer. That would
have been good information to
know at the time. If anyone has a male bunad in a 42L with an "aggressively
unmarried" adornment I can take that off your hands.

While the modern bunad is intended to invoke traditions of the past, it's
actually a 20th century invention. The hero of the bunad movement was Hulda
Garborg, a Norwegian writer, novelist, playwright, poet, folk dancer, theater
instructor, and champion of Norwegian culture. In 1903 she published *Norsk
Kl&aelig;debunad, a book that celebrated the heritage of the bunad and
encouraged Norwegians to construct their bunader of traditional Norwegian
materials instead of imported silk & velvet.

Garborg's prominent advocacy for the bunad led to a proliferation of
*husflidslag*, (roughly translated as folk art & crafts clubs), that kept the
bunad tradition alive.
Today, around 80 percent of Norwegian women own a bunad, compared to only around
20 percent of men; a situation which leads to a google search of "bunad"
returning an array of threateningly beautiful Norwegian women.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Sk&aring;l</h4>
I enjoy a few glasses of champagne over breakfast before switching to beer.

In preparation for the festivities I scooped up a selection of &oslash;l
yesterday from the local grocer before all the stores closed
for the holiday. Among the offerings are the VestKyst IPA from Kinn Bryggeri,
the Littlebro Session IPA & Czech-Style Pils from &AElig;gir Bryggeri, the Fjord
Session IPA from Tya Bryggeri, the Pale Ale & Brown Ale from N&oslash;gne
&Oslash;l plus a few Frydenlund Pales Ale just to be on the safe side.

As I crack into one of the IPAs, Tobias inquires,

"What kind of beer is that?"

"The IPA from &AElig;gir, it's really good, you want to try it?"

"Oh no, I don't like *eepas*"

"See, Tobias, that's where we're different. I love *eepas*"

Nearly 100 years since the end of our puritanical dabble into Prohibition
(December 5, 1933 is Repeal Day,
folks) our Stateside breweries have begun to produce swill so divine our
Continental brethren have begun to copy our style. Imitation is the purest form
of flattery.

So while the decades following our prohibitionary experiment produced swill that
Europeans called "sex in a canoe" (it's fucking close to water) we
have come back with a vengeance, producing beer so big, so powerful, so full of
flavor that our stuffy European antecedents don't know what do to with their
tastebuds. The American spirit will not be suppressed!

We continue drinking our &Oslash;l, *eepas*, and champagne whilst milling about
in Sondre's apartment and jockeying for a good spot on the balcony to soak in
the fabulous weather.

While lounging around I dig into my Dressman bag to pull out a bow tie in the
style of the Norwegian flag.

"What do you guys think of the bow tie?"

If Sondre had a record player this is when the needle would jump out of the
groove as if by its own volition. A room full of Norwegians stares at me

*You're already wearing a paisley shirt and you think it's a good idea to wear*
***That***?

Eventually Sondre pipes up in the most polite way he can muster, "I wouldn't"

I think for a second and it does feel a little over the top. I'm here to
celebrate the holiday and this feels like I'm making a caricature of it.

"Ok I'll wear it as a pocket square"

"Yeah, that looks good," remarks Kristoffer. And generously adds, "maybe you
can put it on when we're drunk at the bar"

Good idea Kristoffer.

Once everyone has stuffed their faces with the bounty of champagne breakfast
assorted groups of friends begin spiriting away to the rooftop patio with
satchels of beer. I help Sondre tidy the abode up before joining the rooftop crew.
Once we summit the building we're greeted by a group of fellas circled 'round a
rectangular flowerbed.

Our slightly sozzled compatriots are presently engaged in an athletic competition
known by the revelers as "King of the Court". KotC pits the King vs a challenger
who must score two points against the King to take his crown. His majesty must
only score a single point to send his lowly peon subject to the gallows and
bring on fresh blood. I'm at a distinct disadvantage seeing as we enshrined the
abolishment of monarchy into our Constitution
on the 4th of March 1789. I had to look up that date (again).

The "net" consists of the aforementioned flowerbed and the paddles resemble
pickleball paddles (they probably are pickleball paddles) with a ball that's
like a smaller, less dense lacrosse ball. It's blindingly simple, unexpectedly
fun, and cycles through players quickly so everyone gets to play without a bunch
of standing around.

</figure>

Of all of Sondre's dozen-ish friends the only one with enough Norwegian pride to
rock a bunad is Christoffer. But don't let the fancy duds and pleasant demeanor
fool you, Christoffer loves to skate.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">"I love skating! Skate 4 lyfe!!!!"</figcaption>
</figure>

Christoffer's best trick on the skateboard is making it look like he's never
ridden a skateboard in his life. He's absolutely fabulous at it. If there were
a professional league for such things Christoffer would be the Michael Jordan of
looking like you've never ridden a skateboard. It's almost like he's never
ridden a skateboard. He's that good. At being not good. A true pro.

While on the roof, a couple of Sondre's friends from the adjacent building join
us; friends whose names go in one ear, sail the high seas of beer and champagne
sloshing around my head, and maroon themselves on my other earlobe. They come
bearing gifts, most
importantly a large pitcher of sangria. And if you're reading this you likely
know that Uncle Andy looooooooooooves sangria wine!

<h4 class="article-subheader">Ok Let's Go to the Bar!</h4>
As our blood alcohol content swiftly rises so too does our interest in athletics
wane. Some time in the mid-afternoon the carousing
committee decides to transfer
the festivities to the bar. As anyone who has tried to herd a dozen half drunk
men, this takes at least two beers worth of time. Eventually we hop on the
trolley right outside Sondre's apartment and head to Syng, a bar overlooking the
mighty Akerselva with private karaoke rooms.

From the street level we descend a set of outdoor stairs that wraps around the
left side of the building overlooking a patio engorged with patrons flying high
on ethyl alcohol and Norwegian pride. Just to the other side of a wide footpath
the Akerselva rages with the runoff of an above average snowpack. The sun is
shining high in the cloudless sky; a beautiful day to celebrate Norwegian
independence.

I duck into the bar and emerge with a round of suds for as many fellas as my
hands can hold. We find an open picnic table overlooking the river and continue
the merrymaking. Soon after we stake our claim a

I also got a bow tie

Don't wear the bow tie

I'll bring it just in case

So I put it in my pocket like a pocket square

A young woman who seemingly decided that the 17 in the 17th of May was the
number of drinks she needed to drink that day 

What's that

Oh it's a bow tie

Can I see?

And before I could say anything she reaches across the table & swipes it from
my pocket

I watch her fumble around with the strap & clasp before she capitulates and
asks for my assistance

I adjust the strap to fit around a non-collared neck and help her put it on

As she thanks me a small white pouch begins to slide down from underneath her
top lip. She guides her grubby forefinger to shove it back up beside her
superior labial frenulum where it belongs. This pouch, known as a "snus", is as
ubiquitous in Norway as hot dogs and genial dispositions. Snus are smokeless
tobacco pouches originating in Sweden, where they have a special carve-out
from their outright ban in the European Union.

Earlier today before we left the apartment I asked to bum a snus from Rolf after
I saw him load a pouch into his upper lip.

"Oh no, this is the max strength, you don't want one of these"

"Hmm, well let me give it a try"

"No I don't think you want one, it's even too strong for Sondre"

"C'mon just let me try one"

"I don't think that's a good idea.... Sondre, can you tell him he shouldn't
take one of these snus"

"Oh yeah, Andrew, you don't want one of those. Here have one of these"

"No, I want one of the extra strength ones, just let me try it"

"You're not gonna like it"

"Just give it to me"

So he did. And within about 2 minutes my face felt like it was going to fly off
my skull.

I guess they were right.

SNUS
The most common refrain I heard regarding snus was "it's like tobacco but it's
not bad for you!" I'm sure my good friend Pete, the Dippin' Dentist &trade; would
support this spurious claim.



At the bar Joakim gifts me his lapel pin with the 3 modern Norwegian kings.
King Harald V took the throne in 1905 when

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">King Harald V, King Olav V, and King Haakon VII.</figcaption>
</figure>

I met Louise outside on the patio overlooking the Akerselva with a line
that's so stupid it just might work,

"Hey I'm American, what's your name?"

Well, to be accurate, this Cassanovian communiqu&eacute; was delivered to
Louise's friend Martine.

So while I'm chatting with Martine, Louise sidles up to let me know I'm
barking up the wrong tree.

"Just to let you know, that's Martine's girlfriend right over there"

I glance across the bar to a stunning Norwegian beauty in an elaborate
form-fitting bunad. Yeah I can't blame Martine there, a significant upgrade
from the mountain troll in front of you.

Typically in a conversation the other party replies to the first but I just sat
and stared mouth agape. Louise breaks the silence,

"Hey, let's go sing!"

So we sang.
