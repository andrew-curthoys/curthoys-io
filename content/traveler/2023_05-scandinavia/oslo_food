<h4 class="article-subheader">Cocktail Hour</h4>
On my last trip to Seattle I purchased a
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/06-seattle?id=bartenders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">book</a>
called "Where Bartenders Drink:
The Last Word on the Glass." One of the 5 listings for Oslo is just up the road
from the Akrobaten so stop at Himkok for a nightcap. Himkook (pronounced
*him-kook* & translates as "moonshine") is one of the earliest entrants to the
cocktail scene in Scandinavia. Their on-site distillery produces house aquavit,
gin, and vodka above a low lit barroom featuring dark wood, gilded mirrors, and
copper piping.

The current cocktail program is inspired by traditional Norwegian sweet treats,
with offerings inspired by multekrem (whipped cream and cloudberries),
berlinerkranser (Norwegian Christmas cookies), and bl&oslash;tkake (cream cake).
Each of the 13 pages of the menu features a single ingredient such as plum,
blackberry, rhubarb, strawberry, apricot, cucumber, and a Northern European
staple, sea buckthorn.

One of the servers roaming
the bar instantly recognizes Brage and sets us up at a nice table right by the
courtyard.

"For you, my friends, I would recommend the 'Bun' to get the full Norwegian
experience. It's made with _______________ and topped with a vanilla pastry.
I would recommend drinking half the cocktail, eating the bun, then noticing how
it affects the flavor of the drink."

"I don't know about you guys but I'm sold"

"A round of Buns for the fellas"

The drink is meant to represent skolebr&oslash;d, a traditional Norwegian sweet
roll filled with custard & topped with icing. The tasty treat was typically
packed as a dessert in the lunchboxes of schoolchildren, hence the translation
of the Norwegian "school bread".
