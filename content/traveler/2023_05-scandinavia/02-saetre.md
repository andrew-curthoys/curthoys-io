I was able to check-in online but couldn't get my
boarding pass, so I

$20 and 20 minutes of impossibly smooth track later I find myself at the
Nationaltheateret train station in downtown Oslo. A far cry from the $60 and
45 minutes-to-an-hour-depending-on-traffic Uber ride I took to JFK. 


"Do you eat meat?"

"Uh... yeah"

"Alright, just checking. I mean you work for a solar energy company and look
like a hippie."

As we finish our beers on the rooftop terrace, Big Tom asks,

wanted the pilsner or the lite, to which I replied "si." Because I'm a moron
and my brain just went with \<any foreign language\>


In Norway they seem to have a feud with the letter "C". Whether it's the soft
c of center (*senter*) or the hard c of "coffee" (*kaffe*) there doesn't seem to
be a c they won't toss in the bin faster than a foreigner in a bunad.
