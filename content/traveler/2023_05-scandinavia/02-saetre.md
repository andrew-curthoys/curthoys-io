<h4 class="article-subheader">Who's Ready for Some Waiting Sausages (cont.)</h4>
I'm sitting on Sondre's parents' rooftop terrace enjoying a Rignes
pilsner when Big Tom utters 6 words that have changed my perception of what it
means to be alive...

"Who's ready for some waiting sausages?"

I've never been more ready for anything in my entire life, Big Tom. Sondre told
me about the waiting sausage on our drive out to S&aelig;tre so I've been
bristling with anticipation the whole afternoon. I might need a waiting
sausage waiting sausage.

Now Big Tom is no ordinary host. He's a host of the highest order, which you can
tease out from the fact he did not say "who's ready for **a** waiting
sausage." Because just as I finish my first *p&oslash;lse med lompe* Chef Tom
hits me with another. Hell I might move to Norway just to wait around.

While we're noshing our *p&oslash;lse med lompe*, Big Tom is working the grill.
Bleu cheese stuffed mushrooms, jalape&ntilde;os, corn on the cob, and potatoes
occupy the grate's real estate. Last on is the star of the show, 4 beautiful
cuts of marinated beef. A feast for a *konge*!

Once the steaks are grilled to a perfect medium rare Big Tom pulls the steaks
and opens a bottle of red. As the steaks rest he puts the finishing touches on
a luscious b&eacute;arnaise sauce. I attack the meal with a gluttonous spree of
gastronomic glee, stretching my ventriculus to its limits. We decide it's in our
best interest to open another bottle of red and chat about what's been going
on with our families.

At one point during the meal Monica asks me if I'm tired and the only honest
answer I could give was "I don't know? I think so?" The human body is a
peculiar organism.

Time has a tendency to fly by when in the presence of good wine, good
conversation, and good company and before I know it I look at my watch and it's
11 PM. This is the first of what will be multiple mind-blowing realizations that
it's *way* later than I expected. This is because, despite being 23:00, there is
still a dusky haze in the sky. It *feels* like 8 PM, it *looks* like 8 PM, but
it's not 8 PM.

I'm definitely tired now. Tired, stuffed, and buzzing on some delicious wine.
I'd say it's high time to hit the hay. What a long strange trip it's been.

I'm sitting on 
The town of S&aelig;tre sits 45 km southwest of downtown Oslo on the
Hurumlandet Peninsula near the Dr&oslash;bak Sound, which separates the Inner
from the Outer Oslofjorden. Sondre is a 3rd generation Huringer - his far and his
farfar both hail from S&aelig;tre.

Which leads me to a quick digression. In Norwegian, the word for father is *far*
and mother is *mor*. Your paternal grandparents are *farfar* and *farmor*, i.e
father's father & father's mother. Same for your maternal side: *morfar* &
*mormor*, which is a cleverly efficient way to avoid asinine questions like
"Is granpa Bj&oslash;rn your dad's dad or your mom's dad?"

<h4 class="article-subheader">Gratuler med Dagen</h4>
After $20 and 20 minutes of impossibly smooth track the Flytoget airport train
drops me at the Nationaltheateret station in downtown Oslo. A far cry from
the $60 and 45 minutes-to-an-hour-depending-on-traffic Uber ride I took to JFK.
I emerge from the subway station to a panoply of colorful sweat-wicking
performance t-shirts. Hundreds of go getters
are gathered outside the National Theatre, prepping, stretching, ogling this
thing they haven't seen for months us Statesiders call "the sun." Apparently
I've arrived right before the start of a fundrasing run that's brought the
whole town out. I find a spot in the shade near a statue of Norwegian actor
Per Aabel looking like he's having a great time.

"Take a picture so I can see where you are"

<little guy dancing photo>

"On my way"

5 minutes later my Norwegian brother shows up with a big bear hug. We head back
down into the train station for the 4 train to Storo, Sondre's neighborhood
5 km to the northeast. I drop my bags & sink into his couch in a heap of
delirious exhaustion.

"Are you hungry?"

"Starving"

"Do you still eat meat?"

"Yeah?"

"OK, just checking. I mean you work for a solar energy company and look
like a hippie."

"Ok that's fair"

Sondre whips me up a leftover burrito and a hot cup of joe. We split a beer
and the combination of it all somehow hits the spot. I muster enough energy
to toss a wad of clothes into my backpack for a slumber party in S&aelig;tre.

We venture down to the basement where he walks up to a car whose tail is plugged
into the wall and clicks some button on his phone to make it beep. He starts
circling the automobile taking photos.

"So these are just shared cars in the basement for anyone to reserve?"

"Yeah it's just an app on your phone and you can reserve a car for however long
you want."

We hop in the car and take the scenic route down the western coast of the
central arm of the Oslofjorden.

"We're going to stop at my grandfather's house first because it was his
birthday yesterday & we should go with him a happy birthday"

"How do you say 'Happy Birthday' in Norwegian?"

"Gundelungendenuglenelengen"

"What?"

"Gutdelundenunderundenernundun"

"You sound like a vacuum cleaner in a bathtub"

"Gurlendugendrundenrmndenemun! How is that hard??"

"Let me look it up... *gratuler med dagen*... Ohhhh grad-you-lare med daggen"

"If you say that to my grandfather he will have no idea what you are saying"

"How do you say it?"

"*Grat-you-lair-eh meht dah-genn*"

"Grattyerlera med dawginn"

"Close enough"

The next 15 minutes are devoid of conversation because the entirety of my
mental faculties are focused on three simple Norwegian words.

*Grat-you-lair-eh*

*Meht*

*Dah-genn*



First stop is *farfar*'s house.

"It's 

farmor, which literally translates to "dadmom", which is a convenient way to
avoid inane questions like, "Is grandma Evy your dad's mom or your mom's mom?"

Farfar Bjorn sailed around the world over 6 years.
From Norway to the Canary Islands, across the Atlantic to the Caribbean, through
the Panama Canal

<h4 class="article-subheader">What Do You Mean You Don't Know About Cape Hatteras??</h4>
"I'm sorry farfar Bj&oslash;rn, I've lived in North Carolina less than a year."

"It's Cape Hatteras! You live in North Carolina and don't know about Cape
Hatteras? It's where you enter the Albemarle sound before The Great Dismal
Swamp!"

"The what?"

"THE GREAT DISMAL SWAMP!"

"I have no idea what that is"

To call Farfar Bj&oslash;rn a seafarer would be an understatement. He cannot
comprehend how I would not know all the navigable waterways up and down the
Eastern Seaboard. I mean he's sailed all of them & he lives an ocean away.

"We left from Norway and sailed down through the North Sea and the English
Channel, through the Bay of Biscay and then around Spain to the Canary Islands.
We then sailed across the Atlantic to the Caribbean, through the Panama Canal
and down the western coast of South America to Patagonia. From there we planned
to go to French Polynesia, but (one of the parts of the sail, let's just
call it the mizzen-jib) broke during a storm and we were unable to sail into
the Pacific.

We sailed back up the coast, got the (mizzen-jib) fixed in Panama, went back
through the Panama Canal, through the Caribbean, and up the Intercoastal
Waterway through the US. Are you sure you don't know the Great Dismal Swamp?"

"I'd never heard of it before this conversation."

"But you live in North Carolina!"

"The US is a big place, Farfar Bj&oslash;rn!"

"Yes, we sailed all the way from Florida to Maine"

"And how long did this sailing around the world take you?"

"6 years"

"6 YEARS!!??"

The indignation of incomprehensibilty that Farfar Bj&oslash; gave me is returned
in kind when I heard this news. 6 years calling a sailboat home. I think I might
get sick of it after 6 days. But then again I grew up 500 miles from the nearest
saltwater.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Middagstid</h4>

Then it's down to Sondre's parents' house and a 7 course steak dinner.

The next morning Monica makes us breakfast on the terrace, <all the brekky stuff>.
I have to imagine heaven is like the past 12 hours.

After brekky we head down to the water to check on the dock. Every year the
residents on the fjord disassemble their docks for the winter. Every spring when
the ice melts the docks are reassembled. Traditional dockbuilding techniques
are preserved - big ass mallets used to drive wooden piles into the mud of the
harbor, cross bracing hammered in place by hand, walkways lashed down each year
anew.

We ask Big Tom if he needs any help with the dock. Fortunately he says he has
it under control and we are released of any labor. I would have helped. But I
have soft hands and I'm still a bit jetlagged. Actually I would have just
gotten in the way.

I can feel the caliber of the glares that the neighboring dock builders shoot
our way behind grizzled faces and calloused hands. We make a quick stroll up
to the town square to pay *farmor* a visit. She's preparing for a 

Cape Hatteras



"Are you tired?"

"I'm not sure"

The way back we take the more direct route through the 4.5 mile
*Oslofjordtunnelen*, i.e. Oslo Fjord Tunnel. It should come as no surprise to
anyone who's
<a href="/traveler/2021_04-ski_trip/wp/day_4?id=bridges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read</a>
my
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/03-wine?id=gg-bridge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous</a>
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/03-wine?id=bay-bridge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posts</a>
that I would have preferred a bridge. In the 1980s a set of 3-pylon cable-stayed
bridges were proposed to ford the fjord, utilizing the island of H&aring;&oslash;ya
as an overland passage, in the same manner as Yerba Buena island with the San
Francisco Bay Bridge. After years of political hemmin' & hawin' they ended up
choosing the tunnel due to expected cost savings of NOK (Norwegian krone) 170 million.

However, during construction the tunneling teams ran into unexpected geologic
conditions, which cost NOK 30 million to mitigate. Then in 2004 geologic surveys
found a section of unstable rock, which necessitated closing the tunnel for two
months & cost another NOK 35 million. And in 2011 the addition of emergency
evacuation rooms cost NOK 40 million. So that's NOK 105 million, without even
adding in the times when the tunnel flooded in 2003 & 2008, and trucks caught
fire in the tunnel in 2006 and 2011 that I wasn't able to find cost estimates
for. In 2016 alone the tunnel experienced over 200 temporary closures. I'm
definitely biased but I think a bridge would have been a better choice.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Brage? No It's Brage</h4>
As Sondre's American tutelage was coming to an end, his family came to visit
Tulsa. That's the first time I met Big Tom and Monica, and when I entered into
an Aboot & Costello routine with his younger brother Brage.

"Ok let me know if I'm pronouncing this correctly, *Brog-yuh*?"

"No, it's *Brehg-yeh*"

"*Breg-yuh*"

"No, *Brehg-yeh*"

"*Brug-yeh*?"

"*Brehg-yeh*"

"*Brog-yah*?"

"*Brehg-yeh*"

This went on for a full two minutes with no resolution. 12 years later and I
still don't think I've ever said it correctly.

We plan to meet up with Brage later this afternoon at the bar he manages in
downtown Oslo. Until then Sondre has some chorin' to catch up on around the
apartment so I go for a little stroll. I walk a kilometer or so down the
peaceful bubbling water of the Akerselva then cut across to a row of cafes and
pubs lining the streetcar line. I stop into what I think is a cute little
independent coffee shop for a cortado and a scone, which Sondre later points out
is a chain with locations all over Oslo. I see dozens of Kaffebrenneriets over
the coming days.

After the cafe I duck into an Irish pub called Lincoln, mostly because that's
the same name as one of Easley's best watering holes in Boston. When ordering a
beer from the rail the barkeep asks me if I want the pilsner to which I reply
"si". Because I guess my dumb brain just substitutes \*any foreign language\*
with the only other one I (kinda) know. It wouldn't be as embarrassing if I
didn't do it ten more times in the next week.

Once Sondre has completed his domestic duties we take a tram down to the Oslo
city center right on the water. The most dramatic structures down here are the
new public library, the opera house, and the Edvard Munch museum.

The library and opera house are generally architecturally revered among Oslofolk,
while the Munch museum is widely decried as the ugliest building in town. I
think it looks like a casino. Which is not the highest praise.

We arrived back in Oslo just in time for Sondre to catch his foundering Arsenal
squad host the Seagulls of Brighton & Hove Albion. Brage is the manager of a
bar called Pokalen in of downtown Oslo. 

<Brage instagram from 24-May>

As we're ambling to the pub I notice the word "barcode" on a lot of restaurant signage.
"What's 'barcode' mean in Norwegian?"

"What?"

"Barcode, it's on all these restaurants, what does that word mean?"

"It means barcode, like... barcode... the thing you scan at the grocery store"

"Oh... I'm an idiot, I thought it was a Norwegian word for cocktails or something"

"No, this is called the barcode district, because these tall skinny buildings
look like a barcode from the water."


Lincoln Sports Bar
I ordered myself a Ringnes. "Pilsner?" the bartender asks, clarifying if I
wanted the pilsner or the lite, to which I replied "si." Because I'm a moron
and my brain just went with \<any foreign language\>


In Norway they seem to have a feud with the letter "C". Whether it's the soft
c of center (*senter*) or the hard c of "coffee" (*kaffe*) there doesn't seem to
be a c they won't toss in the bin faster than a foreigner in a bunad.
