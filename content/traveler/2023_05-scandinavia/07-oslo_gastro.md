"I'll have a gin & tonic"

"Great, and which gin would you like?"

Now... I like gin, but the extent of my knowledge of it is limited to a
handful of the most recognizable brands. If you poured me the finest gin in the
world and a glass of turpentine I likely couldn't tell the difference. Upon the
bartender's query I leer at the chalkboard of available offerings, attempting to
divert his scrutiny of my neophytic grasp of the spirit, searching for salvation
amidst the chalky scribblings.

"Hmmmmm well..... oh! I see you have Bareksten! That will make a fine gin & tonic!"

My choice of Bareksten is predicated on the simple fact that it's from Norway.
While a simple fact it may be for me, a simple fact it is not for the distillers.
Nay, for them it is a point of immense pride.

A quick perusal of their website offers the reader a panoply of piny proverbs,
an array of arboreal aphorisms. It's so over the top it feels like reading the
output of an AI chatbot. In fact I asked an AI chatbot to
write a product description of Norwegian botanical gin, which I present
alongside the official Bareksten copy.

Which is the true Bareksten? You be the judge:

<p class="lead">Ode to gin #1:</p>

<div class="block-quote">
<p>
Bareksten is a celebration of Norway’s pristine landscapes and the
vibrant botanicals that thrive in its cool climate. It's more than a
spirit—it’s an invitation to wander through Norway’s mystical boreal forests.
</p>
<p>
Bareksten features a harmonious blend of handpicked botanicals, capturing the
essence of the Nordic wilderness. Inspired by Viking lore, Bareksten
features ancient herbs like meadowsweet, yarrow, and Icelandic moss, infusing
the spirit with earthy, citrusy, and slightly tart notes. Close your eyes, and
you’ll feel the forest floor beneath your feet.
</p>
<p>
Sourced from crystal-clear mountain springs, the water used in distillation
ensures purity and a smooth mouthfeel. Distilled under the watchful eye of
moonlight, each batch undergoes a sacred ritual. The copper stills hum with
ancient chants, infusing the gin with magic. Bareksten embodies the spirit of
the Arctic.
</p>
</div>

<p class="lead">Ode to gin #2:</p>

<div class="block-quote">
<p>
Bareksten represents the essence of Norway, in both taste and character – dark,
wild, breathtaking and dramatic. Clean flavours inspired by ancient craft
traditions are the soul of Bareksten`s botanical wonders.
</p>
<p>
Norwegian ingredients, touched only by nature, form the basis for the raw
flavours of Bareksten’s botanical spirits. In lonely landscapes inhabited only
by the ‘Hulder’ wood nymphs, who live below ground surrounded by the roots of
old oaks. This is where Bareksten takes its inspiration from.
</p>
<p>
Nordic, natural and organic ingredients form the basis for its unique flavours.
Silent trees. Mighty mountains. Raw nature. Mysterious forests. The taste of
berries and herbs squeezed by Norwegian hands. Bareksten is the bottled essence
of Norwegian nature.
</p>
</div>

I order myself a G&T with a magical gin inviting me to wander through Norway's
mystical boral forests. Or is it a dark, wild, breathtaking, and dramatic gin
inspired by ‘Hulder’ wood nymphs? Whatever it is it's presented in a
splendid crystal goblet accompanied by a glass bottle of tonic to adulterate as
I see fit. The sharp elixir perfectly complements the vibe of the Lorry, which I
would best describe as eclectic sophistication.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">That's how you present a cocktail!</figcaption>
</figure>

The bar/restaurant dates back to the 1870s and has been a favorite hangout for
notable Oslo writers, artists, intellectuals, and all-around rabble-rousers
for 150 years. Throughout its history tortured artists bartered for cocktails
using the work they crafted while toiling in the booths. And many of these works
are still hanging on the walls!

With our Gs & T in tow, Sondre, Nora, & I peruse the incredible assortment of
art and tchotchkes on display throughout the building. As described on Lorry's
website, *"Lorry is known for its extraordinary and eclectic art collection,
carefully collected from all over the World through the years. Our walls are
decorated with 207 art works by over 70 artists."*

As we wander around the main dining area we marvel at the artwork, the
knick-knacks, the figurines, the zebra head, the display of dozens of
corkscrews, the model ships, the old beer bottles. Once again from their website,
*"you are guaranteed surprises and absurdities everywhere you look. A visit to
Lorry will be remembered for a long time."*

I couldn't agree more. And the most unforgettable part of the entire bazaar is
the taxidermied giraffe wearing a bowtie at the top of the stairs.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Izakaya</h4>
One afternoon we're wandering around the Barcode when Nora exclaims, "Oh my
friend works at Vin Bj&oslash;rvika, let's see if she's working!"

So we make a quick ambulatory right turn and saunter up to a wine bar situated
on a promenade overlooking the fjord. Unfortunately Nora's friend is not on
shift but we circle up 'round a table on the promenade nonetheless.

I order a *Solitude Gigondas 2020* from the Rh&ocirc;ne Valley, a full-bodied
red blend of 70% Grenache, 20% Syrah, & 10% Cinsault, if for no other reason
than I've heard people who like wine say things about Cinsault. Can I remember
if they were good things about Cinsault or bad things about Cinsault? No. Will
I be able to taste the difference? Also no.

We pair our vin with a assortment of charcuterie presented as a three-story
tower of epicurean delicacies that perfectly accentuates our waterfront vibes
on this beautiful afternoon.

<figure class="figure">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-6">

</figure>

As we graze each delectable morsel of charcuterie steadily swells our hunger.
Each swig of wine sharpens our focus.

A plan for supper coalesces.

And just like that the Norwegian gastro gang is off on their next adventure,
cruising across town on rented scooters, weaving through historic Oslo
neighborhoods. The streets are mostly devoid of automobile traffic, creating a
feeling of safety that you'd be hard pressed to find in any US city. The few
cars that do occupy the streets, lanes, and avenues of Olso navigate the
thoroughfares at a reasonable pace, deferring to pedestrians, cyclists,
scooter-ers, and other non-car methods of transport. It's a wholly relaxing
urban milieu.

Soon our roving band of heathens arrives at Izakaya, a nondescript Japanese
restaurant occupying the garden floor of a residential building steps away
from a traffic circle featuring the Lysfonene, i.e. fountain of light.

<figure class="figure container">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Probably cooler when the sun's out</figcaption>
</figure>

I have to stoop as we step down to the entrance of the restaurant, a doorway
not befitting the Viking bloodlines of its denizens. The low ceilings and
modest confines tiptoe the line between cozy and cramped. It has a feel of a
place that can only be acquired through decades of repeat customers.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">This'a meal yer gonna have ta stoop fer</figcaption>
</figure>

The menu, in its simplicity, "Japanese dishes and Japanese alcohol."

The wooden tables, well-worn.

Evidence of spilt Sapporo. Of sloppy chopsticks.
Of late nights in a half-basement where you dread leaving the warmth of your
company to bear the frigid Norwegian winter. 

I'm in love.

We find our way to one of those perfectly patina'd tables, seating myself in the
upsettingly comfortable position of "fifth wheel."

First things first. A round of Sapporos & sake.

With our thinking caps properly fueled we dash around the menu

Edamame; seaweed salad; pork dumplings;
*kuriimu chiisu hachimitsu* - cream cheese spread with honey, sesame, and miso;
*kyuuri no kimuchi* - pickled cucumber with chili;
*shiitake bataa ponzu itame* - shiitake mushrooms with ponzu sauce and butter;
*ajitama* - soft boiled egg marinated in mirin, sake, and soy sauce;
*bangbangji* - cold chicken in sesame sauce;
*chijimi* - spinach & cheese fried pancakes;

In line with their clearly stated policy,
"WE SEND THE FOOD OUT AS SOON IT IS READY",
we are treated to a steady stream of delicious morsels in no particular order.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">My amateurish photography makes for an
  inferior representation of the assemblage</figcaption>
</figure>

Between courses a few more rounds of sake adown the table at our behest. The
meal is rounded out with *nama choko* - homemade chocolate truffles
and *kurogoma aisu* - homemade black sesame ice cream.

Everyone ducks through the egress portal a little more robust, a little more
wizened, a little more contented. I feel grateful for the opportunity to break
bread halfway across the world with people I adore. Grateful for my most
memorable dinner in Oslo.

<h4 class="article-subheader">"Sondre Hates Breakfast"</h4>
Sondre and I differ in many ways.

One of those ways is our diverging affinity for breakfast foods.

So when Nora asks, "do you like breakfast?" I instinctively retort,

"Of course I do, I'm not a sociopath"

"Fantastisk!! I love to cook breakfast but don't make it very often because
Sondre hates breakfast. Do you want some breakfast?"

"*Do I!!*"

And as luck would have it Nora is a chef of dawn's early light extraordinaire.

<figure class="figure container">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">This is what it must be like to be King Harald</figcaption>
</figure>

Fried eggs, fresh bread, brunost, yogurt, strawberries, blueberries, and a stack
of pannekaker (Norwegian pancakes) round out the meal with a hot pot of coffee
to boot. I just might could get used to all these <a href="/traveler/2023_05-scandinavia/02-saetre?id=brekky" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rooftop breakfasts</a>.

As one does when the guest of an international rooftop summit Nora and I
discuss diplomacy, geopolitics, religion, human rights, education. We become so
engrossed in the topics of the symposium that Nora looks at her watch and
exclaims,

"Oh crap, I'm going to be late for class!"

"Well go on & git then! Don't worry about cleaning up I'll take care of the
dishes"

A welcome contrast to the typical paradigm of cleaning up America's messes.

<h4 class="article-subheader">"Your accent, where's it from?"</h4>

"I'm Australian, originally from Melbourne"

"No way! My cousin lives in Perth! Beautiful country. How the hell did you end
up all the way up here??"

"Well.... it's a little bit of a long story"

And that's how I met Talor Browne, the owner of
<a href="https://talormade.no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talormade</a>,
a neon obeliscolychny attracting Oslofolk far and wide with its irresistible
good vibes, outstanding coffee, and mouthwatering doughnuts.

Hailing from *somewhere between Sydney & Melbourne*, Talor departed the scorched
landmass she called home for Oslo in 2012 to work for Tim Wendelboe, a man who I have
since learned is a goliath in the world of specialty coffee. In a few short
years Talor worked her way up to head roaster in Timmy W's outfit, making her
the envy of anyone who's pulled a shot of espresso.

After a few years of slingin' beans with the 'boe she got a hankerin' to set off on
her own. She began hosting doughnut pop up events that quickly gained a ravenous
following (oh yeah, she's a trained pastry chef, nbd) and spun up her own
roastery. After all her hard work the universe decided to shit in her latte
because the date she finally opened her first brick-and-mortar location of
Talormade was... February 2020.

Big oof.

So while the timing was less than superb, her doughnuts and coffee certainly
are. As a testament to Talor's hard work I am standing in the
same place where she first opened her doors.

"Well seeing as you hail from down under I'm gonna have to order a flat white"

"Great idea!"

As I take a seat on a plush purple couch Talor calls out over the din of the
espresso machine, "hey, have you ever had a cappuccino al freddo?"

"I've never even heard of such a thing"

"Well it just feels like a cappuccino al freddo type of day & I'm going to make
myself one, would you like to try one?"

"Damn right I would!"

Talor fills me in on the cap al fred - originating in the Greek islands, this
cold coffee drink involves dolloping cold, extremely frothy milk over a couple
shots of iced espresso and topping it with a dash of cocoa powder.

<figure class="figure">
		<img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/traveler/2023_05-scandinavia/oslo-freddo.jpeg" alt="Cap al fred">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">That's some caffeine magic right there</figcaption>
</figure>

I don't
know where in that process Talor imbued witchcraft because I pick up the glass
and can't believe how light it is. *Is this glass filled with air??? What is
happening???* I take a sip and my brain further spirals into a meltdown of
incomprehension. This drink is *impossibly* smooth.

By the end of the beverage I find that I've taken one giant leap into the
world of *too much coffee*.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Tim Wendelboe</h4>
On my final day in Norway, my dalliance with the
<a href="/traveler/2023_05-scandinavia/04-oslo_culture?id=technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Norsk Teknisk Technology Museum</a>
would prove to be my penultimate stop before my Copenhagen-bound ferry. Before
I board the boat I have one more stop. While I was chatting with Talor she said
I had to stop at Tim's shop before I leave, an ultimatum to which I will happily
oblige.

As I leave the Technology Museum I hop aboard the 11N train bound for
Jernbanetorget. A half hour later I jump off at the Sofienbergparken stop for
the 3 block schlep over cobblestones with my backpack and rollerbag.

The shop occupies the bottom floor of a nondescript 4 story building with a
stone fa&ccedil;ade just a stone's throw from the Akerselva. The only indication
that you might be near a world renowned purveyor of coffee is the small KAFFE
sign affixed to the outer wall.

As I stroll 'neath the sign I glance at my watch. I have *some* time to spare
'fore my ship sets sail but the coffee shop run by *2004 World Barista Champion
Tim Wendelboe* is sure to be mobbed right?

Right?

To my surprise the establishment is merely moderately occupied. A dozen-ish
small tables line the perimeter of a space no bigger than a drive-thru Starbucks.
Most of the tables are occupied by couples making small talk or smartly dressed
Millenials gazing intently at laptop screens. I intend to add a shabbily dressed
Millenial gazing intently at a laptop screen to the mix.

I step up to the bar to order my jitter juice and I'm greeted by two
intimidatingly attractive Scandinavians; we'll call him Sven, and her
Olga. Sven & Olga, possessors of a carefree confidence only afforded to the
breathtakingly beautiful, greet me with a smile and a menu.

As if the baristas weren't intimidating enough, the menu lists 5 coffees, each
with its cultivar (think
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/03-wine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wine varietals</a>),
its country of origin, and even its *farm* of origin.

I pick one at random and slink back to my table, back to the realm of the
normals.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Lovely little setup</figcaption>
</figure>

Wendelboe has resisted what must be he opportunity to print money by expanding.
But his singular focus on finding the perfect cup of coffee precludes him from
cashing in on his name.
"I personally find it more rewarding to have one store where I feel the quality
we are serving our guests is consistent and satisfying.”

And "coffee shop" is perhaps too crude a term. "Coffee roastery, espresso bar,
and coffee training centre" appears to be the presentment preferred by Tim
(or more likely the PR firm who runs his website).

They pride themselves on light roast coffee. 
<div class="block-quote">
<p>
We wish to preserve and enhance as much of the natural coffee flavours as
possible so that you will be able to taste the distinct flavours that are unique
to each coffee we import. Therefore we roast our coffees very carefully in order
not to cover our coffees with roasty aromas from darker roasts and at the same
time stay away from the grassy flavours and sour acidity from an underdeveloped roast.
</p>
<p>
Our light roasted coffees are suited for all brew methods, except espresso. The
roast level gives a cup with clarity, brightness and sweetness with little
bitterness and ashy flavours from the roast process.

I slurp down my coffee and head towards the smell of the sea

I have a boat to catch
