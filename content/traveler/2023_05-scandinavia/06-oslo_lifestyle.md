<h4 class="article-subheader">Oslo Has A Smell</h4>
I'm a temporary resident of Oslo for nearly a week before I notice the smell.

A pervasive, gaseous odor permeating the city from Sk&oslash;yen to
H&oslash;ybr&aring;ten. Anywhere you go you can't escape it.

I finally recognize the smell while waiting for an electric streetcar in the
heart of downtown. Underneath the light of a streetlamp I notice the
boulevard is wholly devoid of rambling automobiles; the only passenger vehicles
within my visual grasp sit idly, oat bags full of
ancient grains distilled to an unimaginably potent liquor.

Oslo has a smell.

Standing on that street corner, reveling in the city's automotive scarcity,
I fully appreciate Oslo's olfactory opulence. 

Oslo's smell.

It's the smell of fresh air.

A dulcet urban perfume unblemished by the internal combustion engine's belching
exhaust.

A breath of fresh air that sheds a noxious light on the state of pollution in
the US. Standing on an American street corner you don't notice the pollution.
But standing on a street corner in Oslo you notice the emissions by omission.
With their system of electric trains, trams, buses, bike lanes and - based on a
*vibes only* informal personal survey - 75ish percent of autos locomoted via
electricity, the air in Oslo is downright salubrious.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Casually Modern</h4>
When I think of how I would describe Oslo, the first word that comes to mind is
*sleepy*.

It's a word, but it's not the right word.

Oslo is certainly not *sleepy* - but my opinion is heavily influenced by my
expectation. Having never been to Europe my expectation of a European capital is
a glinty skyscraper jungle fit for the opening scenes of a spy thriller.
Compared to that, Oslofolk might happily consider their hometown *sleepy*.

It's a verdant low-slung city tucked in a valley surrounded by *marka*
forests. The city displays a refined modesty when it comes to the built
environment, tastefully melding the clean lines of modern design with traditional
architecture.

It feels shockingly intimate - from a quick glance at a map it seems at least
75% of the city would fit inside a 5 mile radius of the city center. This,
combined with the city's public transit operating with Scandinavian efficiency, results in the feeling that anywhere in Oslo seems to be *20 minutes away*..

It's a world class city that doesn't make a fuss about it.

It's a city where *shit just works*.

It's a city whose identity I think can be described as *casually modern*.


<h4 class="article-subheader">V&aring;lerenga</h4>
Of all the multitudinous activities of which to engage in this wonderful city
Sondre has arranged a day of sporting for Constitution Day Eve.
The beloved hometown soccer squad V&aring;lerenga is hosting the lads from
Hamarkameratene (Hamar Comrades). Often abbreviated HamKam, the Comrades hail
from Hamar, a town 80 miles to the north of Oslo on lake Mj&oslash;sa,
Norway's largest lake and also home to Lillehammer.

Before the match we meet up at a pub near the stadium with Sondre's friend
Daniel, a HamKam supporter who is, we'll say *realistic* about his team's
chances. "We suck. This is a good match for your first V&aring;lerenga game."

It's still early but HamKam has not fired out of the gates, amassing a dismal
2-4-0 record to date. However, V&aring;lerenga ain't exactly sittin' in the
catbird seat with their 2-3-1 tally.

After a few beers at the pub we set off for Intility Arena. It's about a half
hour walk through some neighborhoods, not too far from the V&aring;lerenga
Kirke (Church), the inspiration for the team's anthem - at some point in the late
70s the church burned down, inspiring Trond Ingebretsen and his band
Bj&oslash;lsen Valsem&oslash;lle to pen the song *V&aring;lerenga Kjerke*
honoring the house of worship. Supporters of V&aring;lerenga football club have
adopted the song as their defacto anthem, belting it out left, right, & center
to support the club.

I plugged the lyrics into an online translator & it feels like the gist of the
song notes that once the roof of timber burned down the church now has the sky
itself as a roof. So that's pretty hardcore.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">It's not THE church, but it is indeed A church!</figcaption>
</figure>

As we approach the stadium we see a line at least 50 yards long of fans waiting
to be granted ingress to the stadium. Sondre whips out his phone and shouts
what sounds like a few steps of making Swedish meatballs into the receiver and
casually walks past the lengthy queue of antsy supporters. As we near the
entrance to the stadium a gentleman in a smart blue suit greets us behind a
wall of temporary metal barricades.

"Hi I'm Daniel, nice to meet you!"

I look over at Daniel, then to Daniel, then back to Daniel. Reckon that's one
less name I have to remember.

(New) Daniel escorts us past the fence & hands us a lanyard with a ticket. Daniel
is Sondre's friend and works for V&aring;lerenga in whatever official capacity
requires him to wear a blue suit to games. Whatever his job I'm thrilled to
lean into his hospitality because our tickets grant us access to the club level
beneath the home stand, the only place in the stadium where you can drink a
beer.

Unlike our Stateside stadia, festooned with beer ads and vendors walking
the aisles lest you have to leave your seat for liquid refreshment, European
soccer arenas have mostly banned alcohol at games in no small part to the
advanced studies of hooliganry Europeans have amassed.

There's also a buffet where Sondre shows me the football special - two sausages
sharing the same lompe.

V&aring;lorenga come out firing, with a goal by Seedyahmed Jatta in the 18th
minute to open the scoring. This is shortly followed by another by
Daniel H&aring;kans in the 24th. As halftime draws near we shuffle out to the
club for some halftime brewskis. Right as we're about to open the door to the
club we hear a roar erupt from the hometown faithful.

3-nil 'renga on a goal from Henrik Bj&oslash;rdal. Well I'll be!

The second half sees no figurative fireworks, ending the way it began, 3-0 good
guys. But it did see literal fireworks, when an opposing supporters threw an
arsenal of incendiary devices on the pitch causing a few minute delay.

After the match all the V&aring;lerenga faithful gather at an outdoor pavilion
for round after round of &oslash;l and round after round of sloppy renditions of
*V&aring;lerenga Kjerke*. I join in with all my new best friends even though I
don't know a single word to the song.

What I saw seems to be a bit of a high point for V&aring;lerenga - they finished
the season in 14th place of 16, placing them in a battle for relegation against
the winner of the promotion playoff from the Norwegian First Division (which is
actually the second-tier in Norwegian soccer. Soccer amirite?)

After a home & away with Kristiansund it was all tied up, sending the
competition to penalties, which V&aring;renga lost in heartbreaking fashion 5
goals to 4. So next year the lads will be slugging it out in the First Division
with hopes to be promoted back up with the big dogs.

A last little denoument for this story - as I was doing some light research
about the club I was delighted to see that a club legend on the pitch as well
as a former manager is cognominated Leif Eriksen.

Happy Leif Eriksen Day! Hinga Dinga Dargen!


<h4 class="article-subheader">Livin' on Tulsa Time</h4>
"You're going to Oslo? You know Andy Mac lives there right?"

"Wait.... what?? Like *Andy Mac* Andy Mac?"

"Yeah, THE Andy Mac lives in Oslo, been there a few years I think"

"Well I'll be damned"

And that's how I found myself seated next to this jabroney 4,500 miles from
Father Hamill Field.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Beautiful day for an &oslash;l</figcaption>
</figure>

We met up for supper & a beer at Oslo Street Food food hall, our party staving
off a ravenous hunger from the day's Nordic Cycle. We catch up over a couple
teriyaki rice bowls and &Aring;ss lagers, my Stateside comrade filling me in on
his journey to the land of the Norse.

I try to keep up with the barrister banter between Will & Andy Mac, lobbing a
few precisely timed *Point of Parliamentary Procedure*!! shouts into the
transcript to the annoyance of nobody I'm sure.

A few more &oslash;ls & a handful of stories later finds us at Crow Bar, a 
craft beer saloon just a snowball's throw from the food hall. During our jaunt
to the Crow we pass a fella ripping a stogie that could substitute as a
cane for Danny DeVito.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">That's one hell of a mouth cannon</figcaption>
</figure>

The Crow also operates a small brewing concern in the back; and as a man who
supports small business, I order myself a Crow's House Ale.

I enjoy a few rounds of suds with the fellas until one by one they grow weary
of my company and scuttle away like rats on a sinking ship. I'm on holiday and
don't have to work tomorrow so I make nonsensical small talk with the bartender
over a Lindheim &Oslash;ysteinnatten Pale Ale.

In the process of flappin my gums I remember that Andy Mac, subsequent to
retreating to his sleeping quarters, mentioned that Lervig is his favorite
brewery in Norway. Armed with this intel I order up a Lervig Supersonic DDH IPA,
a flagon of ale so delicious I feel obligated to order another. 

And maybe another
