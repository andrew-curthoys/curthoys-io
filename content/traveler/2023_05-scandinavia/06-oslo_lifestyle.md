Oslo as a great place to live
* Public transit
* Not many cars
* Almost all cars are electric
* Soccer match

<h4 class="article-subheader">Casually Modern</h4>
It's not until I'm a temporary resident of Oslo for a week that I
first notice the smell of the city.

Or more accurately, lack of smell.

The realization occurs while waiting for an electric streetcar in the
heart of downtown, standing on the curb with nary a rambling automobile in
sight. A handful of cars are within my visual grasp, all of which are
parked tranquilly on the curb, oat bags full of ancient grains distilled to
an unimaginably potent liquor.

It's while I'm standing there on that street corner, observing the dearth of
automobiles that I fully appreciate Oslo's olfactory opulence. A gaseous mixture
almost wholly unblemished by the byproducts of the internal combustion engine's
Otto cycle.

When I try to think of how I would describe Oslo as compared to my expectation,
*sleepy* is the first word that comes to mind. But it's not the right word. It's
not *sleepy*. But it's also not the glinty skyscraper jungle you may come to
expect of a European capital city.

It's a low(ish) slung town sitting in a valley minding its own business. 
It's a world class city that doesn't make a fuss about it.
It's a city where *shit just works*.

After pondering the identity of the city over many ales I decide on a term I
think that most pithily represents the spirit of the city: *casually modern*.

To my surprise I'm amazed at how intimate Oslo feels. With a
metropolitan population of 1.5 million, Oslo would slot 42nd in the US metro
area population rankings, between Oklahoma City and Milwaukee.

At any
point you're no more than a block or two from a subway, tramway, or bus route
that can efficiently ferry you about the city. Due to its
relatively small footprint (from a quick glance at a map it seems at least
75% of the city would fit inside a 5 mile radius of the city center) it feels
like everywhere in Oslo is *20 minutes away*.


After walking around Oslo for a couple days I take in a breath of fresh air and
it hits me how polluted American cities are. The streets of Oslo are mostly
devoid of automobiles, owing to it's walkability and fabulous public transit
system. Based on a *vibes only* informal personal survey it feels like 90% of
the cars on the road are electric.


<p class="article-sub-subheader">V&aring;lerenga</p>
On Constitution Day Eve Sondre has a day of sporting lined up for me. The
beloved hometown soccer squad V&aring;lerenga is hosting the lads from
Hamarkameratene (Hamar Comrades). Often abbreviated HamKam, the Comrades hail
from Hamar, a town 80 miles to the north of Oslo on lake Mj&oslash;sa,
Norway's largest lake and also home to Lillehammer.

Before the match we meet up at a pub near the stadium with Sondre's friend
Daniel, a HamKam supporter who is, we'll say *realistic* about his team's
chances. "We suck. This is a good match for your first V&aring;lerenga game."

It's still early but HamKam has not fired out of the gates, amassing a dismal
2-4-0 record to date. However, V&aring;lerenga ain't exactly sittin' in the
catbird seat with their 2-3-1 tally.

After a few beers at the pub we set off for Intility Arena. It's about a half
hour walk through some neighborhoods, not too far from the V&aring;lerenga
Kirke (Church), the inspiration for the team's anthem. At some point in the late
70s the church burned down, inspiring Trond Ingebretsen and his band
Bj&oslash;lsen Valsem&oslash;lle to pen the song *V&aring;lerenga Kjerke*
honoring the house of worship. Supporters of V&aring;lerenga football club have
adopted the song as their defacto anthem, belting it out left, right, & center
to support the club.

I plugged the lyrics into an online translator & it feels like the gist of the
song notes that once the roof of timber burned down the church now has the sky
itself as a roof. So that's pretty hardcore.

As we approach the stadium we see a line at least 50 yards long of fans waiting
to be granted ingress to the stadium. Sondre whips out his phone and dahses off
what sounds like a few steps of making Swedish meatballs and casually walks
past the long line of antsy supporters. As we near the entrance to the stadium
a gentleman in a smart blue suit greets us behind a low wall of temporary
metal barricades.

"Hi I'm Daniel, nice to meet you!"

I look over at Daniel, then to Daniel, then back to Daniel. Reckon that's one
less name I have to remember.

(New) Daniel escorts us past the fence & hands us a lanyard with a ticket. Daniel
is Sondre's friend and works for V&aring;lerenga in whatever official capacity
requires him to wear a blue suit to games. Whatever his job I'm thrilled to
lean into his hospitality because our tickets grant us access to the club level
beneath the home stand, the only place in the stadium where you can drink a
beer. Unlike our Stateside stadia, festooned with beer ads and vendors walking
the aisles lest you have to leave your seat for liquid refreshment, European
soccer arenas have mostly banned alcohol at games in no small part to the
advanced studies of hooliganry Europeans have amassed.


Club beers - two sausages in one lompe trick Sondre shows me.

Goal by Seedyahmed Jatta in the 18th minute, followed shortly by another by
Daniel H&aring;kans in the 24th. As halftime draws near we shuffle out to the
club for some halftime brewskis. Right as we're about to open the door to the
club we hear a roar erupt from the hometown faithful.

3-nil 'renga on a goal from Henrik Bj&oslash;rdal. Well I'll be!

The second half sees no figurative fireworks, ending the way it began, 3-0 good
guys. But it did see literal fireworks, when an opposing supporters threw an
arsenal of incendiary devices on the pitch causing a few minute delay.

What I saw seems to be a bit of a high point for V&aring;lerenga - they finished
the season in 14th place of 16, placing them in a battle for relegation against
the winner of the promotion playoff from the Norwegian First Division (which is
actually the second-tier in Norwegian soccer. Soccer amirite?)

After a home & away with Kristiansund it was all tied up, sending the
competition to penalties, which V&aring;renga lost in heartbreaking fashion 5
goals to 4. So next year the lads will be slugging it out in the First Division
with hopes to be promoted back up with the big dogs.

A last little denoument for this story, as I was doing some light research
about the club I was delighted to see that a club legend on the pitch as well
as a former manager is cognominated Leif Eriksen.

Happy Leif Eriksen Day! Hinga Dinga Dargen!




<h4 class="article-subheader">Livin' on Tulsa Time</h4>
"You're going to Oslo? You know Andy Mac lives there right?"

"Wait.... what?? Like *Andy Mac* Andy Mac?"

"Yeah, THE Andy Mac lives in Oslo, been there a few years I think"

"Well I'll be damned"

And that's how I found myself seated next to this jabroney 4,500 miles from
Father Hamill Field.

We met up for supper & a beer at Oslo Street Food food hall, our party staving
off a ravenous hunger from the day's Nordic Cycle. We catch up over a couple
teriyaki rice bowls and &Aring;ss lagers, my compadre filling me in on his
journey to the land of the Norse.

I try to keep up with the barrister banter between Will & Andy Mac, lobbing a
few precisely timed *Point of Parliamentary Procedure*!! shouts into the
transript to the chagrin of noone I'm sure.

A few more &oslash;s & a handful of stories later finds us at Crow Bar, a 
craft beer saloon just a snowball's throw from the food hall. The Crow also
operates a small brewing concern in the back, and being a man who supports small
business, I order myself a Crow's House Ale.

I enjoy a couple rounds of suds with the fellas, until one by one they grow weary
of my company and scuttle away like rats on a sinking ship. I'm on holiday and
don't have to work tomorrow so I make nonsensical small talk with the bartender
over a Lindheim &Oslash;ysteinnatten Pale Ale.

In the process of flappin my gums I remember that Andy Mac, subsequent to
retreating to his sleeping quarters, mentioned that Lervig is his favorite
brewery in Norway. Armed with this intel I order up a Lervig Supersonic DDH IPA,
a flagon of ale so delicious I feel obligated to order another. 

And maybe another
