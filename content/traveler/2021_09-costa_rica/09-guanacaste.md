summary: 

Well that was... *something*.

It was most definitely fun, but I did not expect it in
the slightest. I can now honestly say I survived an encounter with a dozen
40-somethings from Eastern Washington. A lesser man wouldn't have lived to tell
the tale.

<h4 class="article-subheader">About That Scuba</h4>

If you remember I casually mentioned scuba diving right before jumping right
into the tale of the Spokane Party Palace. Well I figure now is
a good a time as any to revisit my undersea undertaking.

A shuttle picks me up at my Airbnb at 7:30 AM and drops me off at the Pacific
Coast Dive Center in Playa Flamingo. We mull around for a bit until the rest of
the divers arrive then hop into a bus to take us to the shore. We take a
glorified piece of plywood out to their dive boat, which looks like it can
handle 20ish divers. We only have around 8-10 today so it won't be too crowded.

I climb up to the sun deck on top of the vessel for the hour ride out to the
Catalina Islands. Unfortunately the wine mixer is next week. The weather is
fantastic and we get great views looking back towards the peninsula. We also see
some small rays jumping out of the water and flippin' around. They look like
someone flinging a pizza in the air end-over-end. We ask
the dive master why they do that and he says nobody knows, some scientists
speculate it's just for fun, which I believe because it looks really fun.

</figure>

We arrive at Catalina and after a short briefing we strap up and hop in. The
water feels great but the visibility isn't ideal. It's not bad, just a bit cloudy.
We spend about 45 minutes in the water cruising around the base of the island.
We see a family of 4 white tipped reef sharks, a big ol
sea turtle sleeping on a rock, a spotted eagle ray with what must be a 10 foot
tail, and the most meme-able moray eel I've ever seen.
I forgot to pack the dive housing for my GoPro so I don't have any photos, but
honestly my amateur photos are always shit anyways. Here, have a look at some
professional work.

The second dive has much of the same visually, but we get an absolute treat
sonically. Whale songs fill the sea, echoing and reverberating off the island
rocks. I keep my head on a swivel because it feels like they are so close but
I know it's a longshot. Just yesterday while reading on the beach I learned how
far whale calls can travel due to their low frequency and the efficiency of
underwater sound propagation. So they could be anywhere. Of course I find out
later that our Spokane squad actually happened upon the whales on their dive.
Those bastards.

We head back to town and we all know what kind of shenanigans await me there.
The funny part of it all is that I left my longsleeve SPF shirt on the boat,
meaning I had to wait about 20 minutes at the shop for them to bring it with the
rest of the scuba gear. So if I wouldn't have forgotten that shirt on board I
would have been long gone from Roy's tiki hut before the Spokane crew showed up.
Pretty wild coincidence.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Brew Crew</h4>

Fast forward to post-Spokane and one of the reasons that I decided to come to
Playa Flamingo was a craft brewery tour I found on the line. I've seen a handful
of different breweries at the taverns & gin joints I've patronized on my trip so
why not go give em a tour?

It turns out that I'm the only one who has signed up so instead of their normal
shuttle I'll just get a fella named Ian giving me a ride in his Mitsubishi. Ian
picks me up and we head out to our first brewery, Brothers of Ale (BOA). It looks
like a pretty nice facility with a handful picnic tables among some well manicured
palm trees and an outdoor kitchen. The brewing operation is inside a large white
metal building where the owner, Alex, is waiting to meet us. He gives me the full
tour, including a stop inside the cool room, where we can't help but loiter
because it beats the hell out of the sweltering humidity outside.

The facility is well organized and the equipment looks to be in great condition.
It's a relatively new operation, with the first beers coming off the line in
December of 2019 and the beer garden opening in March of 2020, which for obvious
reasons is the worst possible timing. After the tour we head outside and I order
a flight of the session IPA, Kiwi Brother lager, Oktoberfest, and Dry Irish
Stout. All the offerings are delicious, with the most surprising being the stout,
which has a much lighter body and mouthfeel than I'm used to in a stout.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">In ale we trust</figcaption>
</figure>

By the fourth Red Hot Chili Peppers song I really notice the Cali vibe of the
place. Alex is from Fullerton and you can tell he built what he's used to. I'd
say there's considerable overlap in the California-Pura Vida Venn diagram. It's
a rad spot.

I dump back my flight and we're off to the next brewery - Las Olas in Playa
Grande. When we pull up I can immediately tell this is a different operation.
Whereas BOA had a Cali vibe, this place is unequivocally Costa Rican.

Ian leans over to me, "you ever seen a jungle brewery before?"

No sir, I most certainly have not.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Jungle suds, it's driving me mad, it's
  making we crazy</figcaption>
</figure>

We walk in and Cameron the owner is talking to a couple I suspect then later
confirm is "from the Bay Area." They just stopped in because they noticed the
tasting room from the road, a pulchritudinous open air building made from local
hardwoods. She compliments the woodworking and then launches into the migratory
patterns of various simian populations. Somehow the subject of a developer
illegally bulldozing trees comes up and her solution is
to educate the bulldozer operators about "the environment," aka the forest they've
grown up with their entire lives.

"If they acknowledge a spiritual connection with the Earth they wouldn't have
the will to harm it"

If you acknowledge they are trying to feed their families you wouldn't
say something so fucking stupid. Cameron politely tells her that when you're
making $20/day it's hard to turn down $100 from some gringo in a sportcoat to
tear down a tree. That doesn't even begin to register with Elizabeth from Palo
Alto. Cam does his best to keep his composure, offering the couple some
beers, y'know seeing as we're at a brewery and all.

"Oh no, I'm gluten free. And nothing for him because it affects me if I kiss
him afterwards"

Her spineless boyfriend/husband/valet uncomfortably grins and nods. Blink twice
if you're in danger.

So if you're not going to buy any beer then why the hell are you still here? At
this point the four bottles of mezcal on the bar top catches the eye of our
bohemian busybody. Well maybe they'll at least buy a pour of mezcal.

Yeah right.

It's another 10 minutes of mindless drivel from Elizabeth before they mercifully
leave. Cameron rolls his eyes hard enough to give most people a migraine and then
finally turns his attention to Ian and me.

"Ok so what do you guys want"

"Uhh a flight I guess?"

"Wait, are you on a brewery tour?"

"Si"

"Oh shit! I'm so sorry, I just thought you came in for a beer. My bad, let me
give you the tour."

He takes me out back to the brewing operation & explains his setup. I marvel at
his ability to keep his temperatures in line given the heat and humidity of the
jungle. He shows me his chiller, which must just plow through the BTUs out here.
It's a modest setup compared to BOA but he's financed it all himself and you
can tell he's proud of it and knows how to use it.

We head back in and I get a flight of the Beach Beer (a light, pilsner-style
crushable brew), Helles, Citra Session IPA, and West Coast IPA. They are all
outstanding but I'm partial to the West Coast, so I decide I'll have another. And
another.

The three of us bullshit around the bar, where I learn about Cameron's backstory.
He was born in Costa Rica, where he lived until he was about 10 when his
family moved back to Minnesota. His dad owned a construction business and he
followed in the family business as a civil engineer before getting
sick of it and moving back to CR. He's had his irons in a
lot of fires since his return and this is the first week that the tasting room
has been open. We're some of his first guests, and likely the first to talk
detailed engineering for an inordinate amount of time.

</figure>

After our glasses are empty Ian and I saddle up to head on down to the next
brewery, but not before asking again about the mezcals. Cameron tells us his tale
of traveling through tiny towns in Oaxaca buying up as much small-batch mezcal
as he could get his hands on. He learns us about traditional handmade mezcal,
from the earthen roasting pits to the horse-drawn wheels for crushing the agave
hearts (agave is the scientific name for the plant, the more common name is
maguey. The more you know).

He then tells us about the different varieties of
maguey that are used for mezcal, similar to wine varietals. There are dozens of
different types but Espad&iacute;n is by far the most common, accounting for
around 90%
of mezcal production. We're in luck today, though, as Cameron has two other types
- Cenizo and Madrecuishe (the two on the left in the below photo) - that he says
will knock our socks off.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Mezcal class is in session</figcaption>
</figure>

I'm not even wearing socks - I'm sockless - but if I were they would be nowhere in
sight. Holy shit my tastebuds are having a party. I've had my fair share of
mezcals before but these are on another level. I honestly don't even know how to
describe the taste. All I know is I'm going to keep my eyes out for Cenizo and 
Madrecuishe mezcals next time I'm at the liquor store, my word.

After we recover from that mezcal mindfuck we finally head back to our steed for
the final stop of the tour, Volcano Brewing back in good ol Tamarindo. We pull
into the beachside outdoor bar and belly up. Unfortunately their brewery is up
the hill a piece and they don't do tours so we'll just get the tasting here. No
matter, they have a pretty good spot on the beach and I've worked up a decent
buzz so I'm in no position to complain. I order a flight of the Magdalena Blonde, Volcano IPA, Witch's Rock Pale Ale, Gato Malo Brown Ale and head for a picnic
table on the beach.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">I drank these and then continued on living
  my life</figcaption>
</figure>

Unfortunately the view is far superior to the brew, as all four of the offerings
kinda taste the same. They aren't bad they're just sort of there. But, like
I said, the view is spectacular so all is not lost. Plus there is a live band
over my shoulder and the guitarist is absolutely shredding. After dumping back
my beers and watching the sun set we head back to the car for the journey back
to my Airbnb.

On the way Ian tells me about the incredible hiking tours in the area that wind
up through the mountains among myriad waterfalls. I ask if he's free tomorrow and
since it's the slow season it comes as no surprise that he is. Well hot damn I
could go for a waterfall hike, sounds like a hell of a time, sign me up!

<h4 class="article-subheader">Las Cataratas</h4>

Ian picks me up again in the Mitsubishi, but this time he's brought a friend.
Rusty, an Australian cattle dog, is sticking his head out the window and I greet
him with a good scratch behind the ears. Rusty doesn't like being cooped up at
the house all day so Ian brought him so he can run around a bit.

We start heading towards Rinc&oacute;n de la Vieja, an active andesitic complex
volcano last erupting in June 2020. Rinc&oacute;n de la Vieja translates to "Old
Woman's Corner" and refers to the legend of a princess named Curabanda who fell
in love with Mixcoac, the chief of a neighboring tribe in a Costa Rican
Montague-Capulet situation. Curabanda's father Curabande, did the most reasonable
thing when he found out about his daughter's indiscretion: he threw Mixcoac into
the volcano.

Curabanda, heartbroken, went to live on the side of the volcano, where she gave
birth to a son. Now Curabanda must have inherited the level-headed demeanor of
her father because she made the completely rational decision to throw her son
into the volcano to be with his father. As Ian was telling me this I couldn't
believe the Happy Gilmore level logic I was hearing, but upon further research
that's what the legend says. Crazy family those Curabandes.

On the drive Ian also tells me about some of the indigenous peoples of Costa
Rica, namely the Maleku and the Boruca tribes. The Maleku historically occupied
the area we are now, stretching from Rinc&oacute;n de la Vieja in the north to
Arenal in the south. The Boruca were farther south, towards present day Panama.
They claim to be the only tribe in Costa Rica that were not colonized by the
Spanish, with many traditional customs and traditions surviving to this
day. They are probably most well known today for their large wooden masks that
they adorn for their annual Danza de los Diablitos ceremony celebrating the
resistance of their ancestors against the Spaniards.

</figure>

After my cultural history lesson we pull down the dirt road towards
Don Rafa Adventure Tours. We hop out and let Rusty run around a bit with the
other dogs on the property. We walk over to meet our guide for the hike, a
laconic Tico who sets off down the path with three dogs in tow, Safra, Lucy, and
Lola. It's not long till we get our first glimpse of the water and it's a
ridiculous deep turquoise color, a result of Mie scattering from suspended
minerals. The river also has a high sulfur concentration and has been sought
throughout history for its supposed medicinal powers.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">I think someone murdered a Smurf</figcaption>
</figure>

We continue up the trail and reach our first river crossing. I step in and the
cool water feels incredible on my feet. I reach down and splash some on my face
and it's so refreshing that I reconsider my skeptical stance on its healing powers.
A few more river crossings later we reach our first waterfall.
It's not the tallest but I can jump off it.. so I got that goin' for me,
which is nice.

<figcaption class="figure-caption mb-3">Splashdown</figcaption>

After the plunge we make our way through some steep walled canyons and a few
tight passages. We encounter a couple river crossings that are not for the faint
of heart, this hike *really* makes you work for it.. holy cow.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Lola leading the way</figcaption>
</figure>

Soon we arrive at the second waterfall, and this one is more substantial. We swim
across the river and climb up some rocks and find ourselves behind a curtain
of violent water. We're in a little cave in water up to our chest just soaking
it all in. We swim through the torrent to a ledge where we can sit and let the
water fall on our shoulders and wash all our worries away.

<iframe class="col-12 mb-1 video-div" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CPNPZl1vuLA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<figcaption class="figure-caption mb-3">Waterfall massage</figcaption>

From here we leave the hiking portion of the trip and begin the climbing section.
It's not too challenging, though, and shortly we arrive at a section of the
river that cuts through a narrow crevasse and we're gonna have to swim against
the current like the salmon of Capistrano. It's a hell of a swim and I'm giving
it everything I got. There is a rope overhead to assist but I ain't need it. We
make it to the edge and when we climb out we find ourselves face to face with
Catarata La Leona.

It's a stunning cascade, barreling over the rocks into a crescent shaped gorge
that has been cut through the limestone. The sound of the water crashing on the
rocks gives you a respect for the power of the river and the mist adds a feeling
of calm. Ian has been here a handful of times but he's still
in awe. He tells me that when the river is lower the two streams on either side
of the rock atop the waterfall split and come together in the shape of a heart.
He also tells me the first time he came here he repelled down into the canyon,
which sounds pretty rad.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Nice water feature</figcaption>
</figure>

After getting our fill of the catarata we head back down the trail for a
traditional Tico lunch and hit the road back to town. On the way back Ian
mentions that we'll pass right by Papagayo Brewing, home of one of my favorite
brews: the Passion Fruit Ale. Well dadgum if it's on the way we
might as well stop off for a beer right?

Ian concurs and we belly up to the bar at Papagayo Brewing Company. The first
beer tastes so good I must order another. I must! I must! While enjoying our
second (third) round Ian mentions that this shopping center has two other
breweries - looks like we have ourselves an impromptu brewery tour.

We finish
up at Papagayo and head over to Numu Brewing, which has a pretty nice tasting
room with an upstairs lounge atop a spiral staircase. Ian and I enjoy some
Chorotega IPAs while chatting with Robert the owner, who originally hails from
Chicago. I make sure to serve him a heaping pile of shit-talking regarding the
epic implosion of the Cubs, which is nearly as satisfying as the beer.

The last stop on our spur of the moment beer tour is Captain J Match Brewing
Company, the smallest of the operations we've seen. The tanks are small but the
beers are good. The owner is a Tico named David who is passionate about his beer
and the brewery. It's a spartan space that you can tell he's built up himself
with little outside investment. All the beers are named after beaches in
Guanacaste and the artwork is fantastic, reminiscent of Boruca masks.

Once we've had our fill we say goodbye to David and set sail for home. Along the
way Rusty gets a little tuckered out and climbs up front to take a snooze on my
lap. He's a goooooood boi, a very good boi.

I've arranged for Ian to take me to the airport tomorrow so we discuss logistics
before he drops me off for my last night on Tico Time. If anybody makes a trip to
the west coast of Costa Rica <a href="https://crlimocompany.business.site">
hit up Ian and Patsy</a>, they are great people. Plus they have a 4WD Ford
Excursion limo, which I respect the hell out of for the sheer audacity of it alone.

This is when the international version of the Sunday Scaries hit me hard. It's
been a downright adventure from start to finish. I'm not ready to leave but I have
obligations that require my attention elsewhere (no I don't I'm unemployed, what
the hell do I have to do). As much as I want to bail on my flight tomorrow I
think better of it and pack up all my stuff before hitting the sack.

Costa Rica, it's been a damn pleasure. Buenos noches.
