summary: It's an easy 15 minute taxi ride to the bus terminal. We hop on the bus and it's hot, sticky, and devoid of leg room. I ask the woman next to me how long the ride is and she pulls out a map and estimates 4 hours. Yikes.

It's an easy 15 minute taxi ride to the bus terminal. We hop on the bus and it's
hot, sticky, and devoid of leg room. I ask the woman next
to me how long the ride is and she pulls out a map and estimates 4 hours. Yikes.
As we wind through the logjammed streets of San Jos&eacute; I wonder if I've made
the wrong decision. This is miserable. As we exit the city we pick
up some speed and the wind through the windows feels excellent. The temperature
drops a bit as we make our way up through the mountains and the views are
breathtaking. My mood improves accordingly.

We make our way over the mountains and the scenery flattens out and the
mugginess returns. It's 4.5 hours to Cahuita, where the woman next to me
disembarks and I am able to stretch my legs out a bit. 30 more minutes and we're
in Puerto Viejo and I am ready to get off this damn bus. We disembark and wind our way through
a cozy little beach town to the Roots Family hostel, where C&eacute;cile has booked
a bed. We are greeted by Emily, a petite girl from Essex with the most proper
British accent you could imagine. She's just beginning her gap "6 months" since
she wasn't allowed to do a gap year.

She's volunteering for a month at the hostel & just arrived late last night so
she's still getting oriented with the place. She thinks there are beds for Mia
and me but sends her boss a text to make sure. Turns out there is only one
bed available in the dorm but there is a vacancy for a private room. The dorm is
$15/night and the room is $30. Mia is content with the dorm so I take the room.
In a stroke of mighty good fortune, the proprietor of the place texts Emily back
and informs her that I can stay in the room for the same price as the dorm.

Wunderbar!

I plop down my bags and wander out to the common area. We have all worked up
quite an appetite from that bus ride so we walk down to the beach to a little
cafe for some grub and a couple beers. We take in the sunset before heading
back to the hostel, where we meet a set of brothers
from Switzerland, a couple girls from Lithuania, a fella from South Africa, and
a bloke from Germany.

We head down to the supermarket to snag some beers and make our way back to the beach for some
revelrous escapades. The town is small but it's buzzing and we party on the
beach through the night. I can dig the travel life.

The next morning I wake up and go for a nice run on the beach. Toxins flushed, I
return to the hostel to a minor emergency. A pretty sizable crab, who the group
has named Henry, has wedged himself between the refrigerator and the kitchen
trash can. Me, the idiot, looks and estimates that Henry couldn't possibly wrap his
claws all the way around the back of his body - so I grab the big bastard from the
back and quickly learn that growing up 500 miles from the nearest saltwater
source is not conducive to your knowledge of marine wildlife and Henry clamps down
on my finger something fierce. I throw him down and he scurries outside so while
the execution was unorthodox, the end result was his extrication from the domicile.

Henry situation resolved the group discusses taking a bus to Cohuita for a
hike around the Cohuita National Park. This place is famous for the wildlife,
with sightings of monkeys, sloths, bears, snakes, and all kinds of other fauna
a common occurrence. While waiting for the bus we meet a gal named Jackie from
Dallas. How fortuitous that I met someone who only lives so close & the Swiss
kids say that 4 hours away is an eternity for them. They say they never go skiing
because the mountains are 2 hours away. Those ungrateful sonsofbitches.

The bus arrives and it's a 30 minute ride to the park followed by a short walk
to the park entrance. The animals must hear us coming because we don't
spot anything other than some lizards and a raccoon trying to steal food out
of hikers' backpacks. A few miles into the hike we decide to cool off at one of
the beaches we come across. On our return journey we spot a family of spider
monkeys swinging through the trees, eating a bite of fruit and violently
throwing it to the ground. It was quite a spectacle and worth the price of
admission. We make our way back to the bus terminal and back to Puerto Viejo.



On the way back from the bus stop we stop at the supermarket to pick up some food and some liquid
refreshments. The younger of the Swiss brothers and the German guy snag 4 pounds
of pasta and I grab a bottle of wine to go with it. We get back and the two
amateur chefs go about making 4 pounds of pasta just like you'd imagine two half
drunk 20 year old Europeans would do. While the pasta is cooking I learn that
Emily has recently earned her degree in Maths so we discuss maths for a while,
where the conversation eventually leads to quantum mechanics, as any conversation
with a wannabe physicist like me will end. This attracts a crowd and I blow
everybody's nips off with the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics -
which I only know about because of Sean Carroll's podcast (great listen btw).

Luckily the pasta finishes soon after this discussion begins because the shallow
well of my knowledge is running dry. I want to keep up appearances with these
kids that Oklahoma Jesus knows what he's talking about. The food is served and I
pass around the wine and everyone is merry.

I fill my belly and finish the last of my beers in the fridge and arrive at the point in the night
when decisions need to be made. I ask the group if they are planning on going
out or think we'll just stay at the hostel. The consensus is to stay put so I
do the reasonable thing and walk down to the supermarket and buy 5 bottles of
wine and a 6 pack of beer.

By this point everyone has been drinking on their own stash and we're all a bit tipsy so
we naturally begin playing some drinking games. We play versions of games that I
remember playing in college and the wine is going down easy. The party migrates
outside where the final game doesn't end as much as people lose the capability
to pay attention longer than 10 seconds.

Different songs are played from different countries then I bring down the house
with a little Earth, Wind, and Fire. We're all dancing like half drunken idiots
because we are half drunken idiots. What a time to be alive.

Speaking of half drunken idiocy, feats of strength are naturally in order and I
defeat the Swiss kid in a pull-up contest and he bests me in a pushup contest.
This is Grade A lunacy and I love it. I stumble to bed some time after midnight
with a belly full of cheap wine and a head full of mis-firing neurons.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Tortuguero</h4>

I am awoken by the sound of a driving rain on our tin roof at 5 AM. I mean it's
really coming down. Guess that's why they call it the rainy season. I manage to
get back to sleep for a few more hours before my alarm squawks at 7:30 for an 
8 AM shuttle to Tortuguero National Park. I frantically
pack my stuff, making sure to forget my water bottle and flip flops in
the process. No way I'd need my water bottle on a cheap wine hangover and a 4
hour multi-modal trip ahead of me. Certainly not.

During the day yesterday I had "reserved" a spot in the Lithuanian gals' rental car
but one of their friends unexpectedly showed up early and
my spot in the car vanished like a fart in the wind. C&eacute;cile
& Levent, the German fella, were super excited about Tortuguero and had reserved
the shuttle. I had nothing better to do so that is how I find myself in my
current situation - on a shuttle bus with an anti-vax driver whose stupidity would be evident to
someone with a week's worth of Spanish classes.

He is telling C&eacute;cile how the vaccine is a scam and Covid is a
conspiracy by world governments to kill all the old people. Thankfully she's the
most adept Spanish speaker & I just pretend not to understand him when he asks
me something. After he's gotten all of his Covid opinions out in the open he
checks the "Afghanistan" square off the
shit-you-don't-want-to-talk-to-your-shuttle-bus-driver-on-vacation bingo card.

This guy won't shut up. I wish my headphones weren't packed up in the back of
the van. At least there is one funny part about his rambling when he reveals that
he has 10 kids. When he mentions that he has two 23 year olds C&eacute;cile asks
if they are twins, at which point the best part of the story tumbles out of his
jabberbox. The 10
spawns of his are from 5 different women. I wonder if he can name them all.

While I was pretending to not know what nuestro coductor de autob&uacute;s was
talking about Levent had the pleasure of actually not knowing what
he was talking about. Gl&uuml;cklicher Hund. We mercifully make it to the dock
and the dreary rain starts to let up a bit. I take a look at the boats at
and if it does rain we're going to get
absolutely soaked. I didn't imagine taking a 3 hour ride on a glorified bathtub
when thinking about my activities for this trip so I'm regretting my decision to
bring a computer.

The fellas on the dock bring down a couple boxes of black trash bags and start
stuffing everyone's bags into them. At least my computer will get ruined *slower*
if it does rain. Luckily the rain stops before we weigh anchor and it holds off
for the entire ride. It was a neat little boat ride - we saw some monkeys, a huge
iguana, a few caymans (essentially lil crocodiles), and assorted other wildlife.
We pull into the dock at Tortuguero mid-afternoon and check into the hostel.

The operators of our hostel also run a tour company offering guided canoe and
kayak tours of the park. We peruse the information and defer a decision until
after we get some food in our belly. We head down to the Buddha Cafe where I
order the ceviche & a beer, which takes an insane amount of time to arrive and,
while tasty, was only a meager portion. And I also found a small worm crawling
around in it. Surf & turf.

The others' meals weren't much better & we left the joint in a bit of a sour
mood. Our spirits further dragged down when we arrived back at the registration
office for our hostel to find it closed for the day. Sunofabitch.

We trudge back to the accommodation and whilst discussing what to do tomorrow
on the hammocks the proprietor wanders by. We flag him down and tell him we'd
like to take a guided tour in the morning. He tells us all the guides are
already booked on canoe tours, but we can book kayaks and follow one of the
canoes and get all the benefits of a guide with the freedom of our own kayak.
Plus he gave us a discount because the guides were booked. Pura Vida.

The only downside is we need to meet at the dock at 5:45 AM so we call it an
early night and rise at the crack of dawn. We get strapped into our watercraft
& head out into the water, following the canoe with its small electric motor. It
putters along pretty slow so it's not much of a chore keeping up. The guide tells
us all about the park and guides us down a few rivers pointing out wildlife as
we go along. We see, in no particular order, monkeys - of both the spider &
howler variety - parrots, sloths, caymans, basilisk lizards, and numerous birds
drying their wings in the sun after the morning rains.

After about 2 hours of touring on the river, the canoe turns back and leaves us
on our own to continue adventuring at our leisure. He recommends heading upstream a
bit then veering to the right when the river forks. We do as he suggests and
it's narrower and swifter than the previous stretches of river
we've navigated. It's quite fun. We continue that way for about 45 minutes when we
reach a downed tree across the river that we could get across if we really
wanted to, but we're feeling a bit peckish and hot so we decide to turn back.
We riverside our bows and I work up a little lather on the
return journey, might as well get a little workout in while I can.

We stroll around the little town when we get back, purchasing some t-shirts and
assorted knickknacks. As we're walking around we see a sign in front of one of
the tour companies offering a shuttle service to La Fortuna with an optional
white water rafting tour en route. The other option via public bus will
require 5 transfers so we decide that it's a no brainer and book the shuttle &
rafting.

The catch is that we need to be at the docks an hour earlier than we were
today - 4:45 for a 5 AM departure. Hoo boy, hopefully this is worth it (spoiler
alert: it was).

After booking the rafting/shuttle we walk down to the edge of town to the
walking portion of the park. It's a 2 km hike down a path through some dense
jungle where we see more of the same flora & fauna with the faint din of waves
crashing a few hundred feet to our left. We get to the end of the trail and decide
to walk back along the beach. I think there'd be much less aggression in this
world if everybody got a chance to walk 2 km down a Caribbean beach from time to
time. It was pretty magical.

We make it to the turn off for the hostel & grab a round of beers from a
beachside bar to watch the sunset. Just as we sit down a Swiss dude & German gal
who just checked into our hostel wanter by with a 6-pack & we flag them down and
all take in the scenery together.

After the beers & sun have both been downed we head back to the hostel & whip up
a dinner that my college self would be proud of - corn, bean, & avocado tacos and
scrambled eggs with red peppers and American cheese. In hostelworld when you're
splitting town the next morning you cook whatever you have on hand, and by god
did it hit the spot.

After supper I walk across the street to a bar to catch the second half of the
Costa Rica - Mexico World Cup qualifier. Mexico is up 1-0 when I arrive and that's
what the scoreboard reads when the final whistle is blown, despite two great
chances at the end from Costa Rica, one ball going off the crossbar in the 2nd
minute of extra time. I walk out to the water to finish what's left of my beer
and gaze at the stars and the lightning storm brewing on the horizon. I drop off
my empty bottle at the bar and head back to the room and set my alarm for 4:20.

Big day tomorrow.
