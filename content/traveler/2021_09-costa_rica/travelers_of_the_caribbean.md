C&#233cile & Mia are waiting for me in the lobby and our ride pulls up right on
time. We all pile in and it's a 15 minute taxi ride to catch
the bus to Puerto Viejo. We hop on the bust and it's hot, sticky, and devoid of
leg room. I ask the woman next
to me how long the ride is and she pulls out a map and estimates 4 hours. Yikes.
As we wind through the logjammed streets of San Jos&#233 I wonder if I've made
the wrong decision. This is miserable. As we exit the city we are able to pick
up some speed and the wind through the windows feels excellent. The temperature
drops a bit as we make our way up through the mountains and the views are
breathtaking. My mood improves accordingly.

We make our way over the mountains and the scenery flattens out and the
mugginess returns. It's 4.5 hours to Cahuita, where the woman next to me
disembarks and I am able to stretch my legs out a bit. 30 more minutes and we're
in Puerto Viejo and I am ready to be off this damn bus. We make our way through
a cozy little beach town to the Roots Family hostel, where C&#233cile has booked
a bed. We are greeted by Emily, a petite girl from Essex with the most proper
British accent you could imagine. She's taking a gap "6 months" since her
soon-to-be employer wouldn't let her take a year.

She's volunteering for a month at the hostel & just got there late last night so
she's still getting oriented with the place. She thinks there are beds for Mia
and I but she sends her boss a text to make sure. Turns out there is only one
bed available in the dorm but there is a private room available. The dorm is
$15/night and the room is $30, Mia is content with the dorm so I take the room.
In a stroke of mighty good fortune, the proprietor of the place texts Emily back
and informs her that I can stay in the room for the same price as the dorm.
Wunderbar!

I plop down my bags and wander out to the common area. We have all worked up
quite an appetite from that bus ride so we walk down to the beach to a little
cafe for some grub and a couple beers. We take in the sunset before heading
back to the hostel, where we meet a set of brothers
from Switzerland, a couple girls from Lithuania, a fella from South Africa, and
a bloke from Germany.

We snag some beers from the supermarket and make our way to the beach for some
revelrous escapades. The town is small but it's buzzing and we party on the
beach through the night. I can dig the travel life.

The next morning I wake up and take a nice run on the beach. Toxins flushed, I
return to the hostel & the group is discussing taking a bus to Cohuita for a
hike around the Cohuita National Park. This place is famous for the wildlife,
with sightings of monkeys, sloths, bears, snakes, and all kinds of other fauna
a common occurrence.

We head out on the trail and the animals must hear us coming because we don't
spot anything other than some lizards and a raccoon trying to steal food out
of hikers' backpacks. We hike a few miles and cool off in the water at one of
the beaches we come across. On our return journey we spot a family of monkeys
swinging through the trees, eating
