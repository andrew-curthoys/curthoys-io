activity: September 2021 Costa Rica
summary: After a full day of activities I hit the sack and I'm out like a light. The only disturbance was a 2x6 wooden slat falling from the underside of my bed and slamming against the floor at 3 AM. That certainly woke up everyone in the room. Lo siento. Even though it wasn't my fault. 

After a full day of activities I hit the sack and I'm out like a light. The only
disturbance was a 2x6 wooden slat falling from the underside of my bed and slamming against the
floor at 3 AM. That certainly woke up everyone in the room. Lo siento. Even
though it wasn't my fault. I wake up an hour later to find that the damn board
fell squarely on my computer. It's got a pretty serious ding on the lid and I'm
afraid to open it to see the damage. To my relief I open it and find it fully
functional. What a lucky break. I think I'll get a Costa Rica sticker to put
over the dent, I think that will be pretty fitting.

We arrive at the dock at 4:45 and pile on a boat that at least has sides that
roll down in the case of rain - but luckily we don't encounter any in the hour
ride to meet up with a car to take us to another town where we'll meet a shuttle.
We're going to get a full sampling of various Costa Rican modes of conveyance:
boat-car-bus-van-raft-shuttle.

The car ride is about an hour, where we wait about half an hour for the shuttle,
then another half hour or so to the rafting location. They serve us a full
Costa Rican breakfast of gallo pinto & eggs with coffee then we pile on a van
to ride 18 km upstream where they'll drop us in the rio. We get a safety briefing
and coaching on what to do when the guide barks various commands at us and we
strap on our lifejackets and helmets.

I get put on the Spanish only raft so I
quickly learn that when Eduardo Espiritu Santu barks "adelante por favor" that
means I should paddle forward. "Atras" means paddle backward, and something like
"izquierdo adelante, derecho atras" means I'll paddle backwards, seeing as I'm
on the right side. As a little bit of added pressure, I'm at the front of the
raft so I can't just look to see what everyone else is doing like I'm at yoga
class - I have to trust what I hear from Eduardo at the back of the vessel.

We head on down the river & pretty quickly encounter some pretty serious rapids.
Eduardo is shouting orders and we're all working in lockstep, guiding our raft
down the waterway. There are certain times when he's telling us what to do I'm
pretty sure the river was going to do to us what she wanted no matter how much,
how hard, or which direction we paddled.

But I have to say it was fucking *fun.* My god what an adventure. The rapids
were pretty consistent the entire way down the river with only short stretches
of flat spots between rapid sections. The quiet spots weren't without their
benefits though, it gave us some time to catch our breath and enjoy the
ridiculous scenery. The entire way down the river we're flanked by mountains
and cliffs on either side with the thickest vegetation you could imagine. It was
pretty incredible to witness.

Then about 3/4 of the way down we came to a canyon with 200 ft sheer walls on
either side & the guides allowed us to hop out of the raft and float along. The water
was crisp and the breeze coming through the canyon felt like heaven.
If anybody on the trip had a worry on their mind I'm sure it just floated on
down the river.

Pura Vida. Pura Vida indeed.

There are a couple more stretches of rapids before we make it back to the start.
We hop off & walk back to the muster point, where they have lunch ready for us
at the same place we are breakfast. I grab a plate & a round of beers for our
crew and Matt, who we met today and hails from Fayetteville. We enjoy our food &
beer and swap stories from the river. Up on the TV they have photos they took
of everyone in the rafts & we all laugh at the photos as they scroll by.

After lunch we hop back on some shuttles headed to different locations & say
goodbye to Matt, who is headed to Puerto Viejo, and Jackie, who we met a couple
days ago in PV & is headed to San Jos&eacute; and an airplane in the morning to
take her back to the real world.

We are only 3 on our shuttle to La Fortuna so we have plenty of room to stretch
out, read, sleep, relax before La Fortuna and the Arenal volcano.
