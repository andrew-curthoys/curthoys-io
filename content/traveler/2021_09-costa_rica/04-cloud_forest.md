summary:

We rise in the morning and pack our stuff before making the short walk to our 
shuttle to take us to Monteverde. We hop on for a short ride to Lake Arenal, where we
offload and get ready to hop on a boat for a ride across the lake. I need to
take a leak so I wander over to a wooded area by a stream and just as I'm about
to do my business I see a tortuga in the water munching on some leaves. I wave
the group over as subtly as I can so as not to scare the big fella but by the
time they make it over here he's dipped down to the bottom of the channel. We
can still see his head but it's partially obscured by some leaves.

We keep an eye on him, waiting to see if he'll move back and continue his
snacking when the guys on the boat whistle us over to load up. We climb on the
boat and take a serene ride across the lake. 45 minutes later we hop off & pile
into another shuttle.

When I went to pee earlier before being interrupted by the excitement of seeing
a sea turtle I *kinda* had to pee. Well now I *really* have to pee and the road
out of there is unpaved and
rocky as hell. We're getting jostled up the side of a mountain & it's taking every
ounce of concentration to hold back the floodgates. We're on this for about 30
agonizing minutes before we reach a paved stretch of road and a sign for
Monteverde 29 km ahead. 18 miles that should take about half an hour given our
current pace.

10 more minutes of squeezing, holding, squirming.

Monteverde 20 km.

I'm seriously considering asking the driver to pull over so I can pee on the side
of the road.

Then just as my misery is reaching an all new high the driver pulls off to a
small cafe on the top of a hill. He says something in Spanish but I don't even
try to listen & dart out of the van like 2008 vintage Usain Bolt. I dive into
el ba&ntilde;o caballeros and release the longest, most satisfying urinary
movement I've ever experienced. Good god am I glad he pulled over.

My apologies to everyone who didn't have "read a 400 word pee story" marked down
on their calendars for today.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Monteverde</h4>

We make it to Monteverde shortly thereafter and stumble into the Sleepers hostel.
We talk to the very
nice young man at the front about activities for tomorrow and he gets
C&eacute;cile and I scheduled for the
"Extremo zip line/bungee jump bundle package." Levent isn't one for heights so
he'll do his own thing tomorrow.

I see some ads for coffee tours so I ask about taking one this afternoon. There
is a chocolate/sugar cane/coffee combo tour that goes off in about an hour & I
sign myself up. I head up to the room and take a quick nap before meeting the
shuttle driver down in the lobby for the tour.

We head out to the Don Juan coffee plantation where I am greeted by Geronimo, who
will serve as my tour guide. Nobody else seems to have signed up for this
timeslot so it looks like I'll be getting a personal tour. Rad.

Geronimo leads me to the chocolate section of the tour, where he explains the
history of the cacao plant, known to the ancient Maya as the food of
the gods, and the traditional process
of growing, harvesting, and processing the plant to make chocolate. He grinds
some cacao beans and lets me taste them, which are much more bitter and earthy
than the corn syrup sludge that passes for chocolate in most of the US.

He takes the ground cacao and proceeds to make 2 separate preparations: Belgian
and Mexican. The Belgian version he adds sugar, a dash of vanilla, and a touch
of warm water to make a chocolaty paste. For the Mexican preparation he adds the
vanilla, a bit less sugar, and includes cinnamon and cayenne powder. He then adds
a good amount of hot water to make a tea. He then hands them over to taste and
they are both spectacular. The flavors are impossibly rich and complex. Food of
the gods indeed.

After gobbling down all of the delicious concoctions on offer we continue on to
the sugar cane portion of the tour. Geronimo hacks off a section of sugar cane
and hands it to me to taste. I chew it and the fibrous stalk releases a subtly
sweet liquid that really hits the spot. He tells me that sugar cane
has been a vital resource for farmers feeding their livestock since the advent
of agriculture due to the cane's high energy density.

He shows me a rig that can be used to ferment the sugar cane and make a liquor
called guaro, the same as the drink I had a few days ago in La Fortuna. We then
get to what was my favorite part of the entire tour. Geronimo takes a stalk of
sugarcane, splits it down the middle & puts a few sprigs of rosemary in between
the two halves. He then readies a contraption for squeezing the cane that looks
like an oversized pasta roller. He loads the cane into the machine & we turn the
crank to squeeze the juice into a pitcher. A few more times through the crank and
big G pours me a glass.

</figure>

Holy hell what an elixir. It's so simple but so damn tasty. The rosemary adds
a subtle soupcon of herbaceousness that complements the sugarcane juice in just
the right way. I throw it back and ask for seconds. Geronimo obliges and pours
himself another glass as well. It's a damn fine beverage and worth the price of
admission.

The tour continues to the coffee portion, where Geronimo shows me some coffee
seedlings at various stages of growth. It takes nearly a year of transplanting
before the plants can be put out to the fields. Coffee grows as a green berry,
with 4 layers protecting the innermost seed, which is what we refer to as a
coffee "bean." In Costa Rica the harvest season
is November-February, and the Costa Rican schoolyear has been structured to allow
a break during this time for help in the coffee fields. All coffee in Costa Rica
is picked by hand and it's a very labor intensive process.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">This was actually from a book I found in a
  coffee shop a few days after the tour. Cartoons are good.</figcaption>
</figure>

Once the coffee has been picked it needs to be processed, which can be one of 3
main methods: natural, honey, or traditional. In the natural process, the entire
coffee berry is set out to dry before roasting. In the honey process, the two
outermost layers of the fruit are removed, leaving the
sweet, sticky mucilage on the outside for drying. And the traditional process
removes the mucilage, leaving the 4th layer, called the silverskin, for drying.

After the coffee is dried the beans are processed through a machine that removes
all the outer layers, leaving only the coffee bean that we're familiar with. The
coffee can then be exported and all that's left to do is roast it. Anyone who's
been to a yuppy coffee shop has seen the roasting contraptions - a big heating
barrel that roasts the beans to the desired doneness and a large tray with a fan
to cool them once finished.

This concludes the tour and Geronimo leads me back to the main building where
they have samples of different coffee roasts that they have brewed. I enjoy a
delicious cup of coffee then hop back on the shuttle to the hostel. I wander
down to Taco Taco for a quick snack of pork carnitas tacos and an El Rayado Pale
Ale from Monteverde Brewing here in town. The rest of
the afternoon is spent reading and we turn in early for a big day of adventuring
tomorrow.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Adrenaline</h4>

I wake up and guzzle down a cup of coffee and breakfast before our 8 AM shuttle
to Extremo Adventure Park. We've got ziplining, a Tarzan swing, & bungee jumping
on the agenda - we've seen some videos of people we've met do the bungee and it
looks wild.

We get all checked in and geared up and after a safety briefing we head out to
our first zipline. The first few are relatively tame, I reckon to get everyone
used to it. We then take a zip between two mountain ridges hundreds of feet
over a lush green
valley with a river running through it. It's exhilarating and peaceful at the
same time. The last two zips are "Superman" style, meaning they reverse the
harness to clip in the back and add straps to hold your feet and you fly down
the line like Superman. We zip back across the valley and I feel like a bird
soaring over the valley & darting between trees. I'd be a kickass bird.

Thus concludes the zipline portion of the day & we head to the Tarzan swing.
This is a 300 foot rope attached on one end to a cantilevered tower 470 feet in
the air with the other end attached to... you. The guides get you strapped in and
pull back the floor and then release the clasp to let you free fall down a 300'
pendulum arc. During the initial descent my body tensed up so tight I couldn't
even breathe. It was a fucking trip. The swing goes out a bit over the valley
so you get some great views before you swing back down the other way.

I ran some calcs and came up with a number just under 95 mph for the speed at the
bottom but
that couldn't possibly be true. I found a calculator for this sort of thing
on the internet and sure as shit we were going damn near 100 mph at the bottom
of that bastard (ignoring air resistance, of course). Insanity.

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Don't blame me for the vertical video</figcaption>
<br>

Everybody on the tour did the Tarzan swing but only a select few of us were
daring enough to do the bungee. C&eacute;cile has been talking a big game and
opts for the jump as does our friend Nir and two other Israelis. The group in
front of us finishes their fun then the bungee rig traverses back
across the valley to where we are waiting. I should mention that the platform
is suspended on a series of cables strung across the valley. So when we jump we
won't even be on terra firma. Extremo.

We ride the metal box out to the highest point of the valley and I am volunteered
to go first. The guides strap on the ankle harness and hand me a helmet, the most
pointless piece of safety equipment imaginable. They give us a briefing on what
to do then it's nut cuttin' time. I have been pretty confident up to this point
but when I step to the edge of the platform shit gets real. At least on the
Tarzan swing you're hanging from your harness & can feel it pulling you up.

With this you don't have anything to give you a sense of security. You just
gotta go for it. I'm sure my heart was racing a mile a minute at this point and
since they do this every day one of the guides begins a five count and it's just
the incentive I need to get over the hump.

He gets to 1 and I swan dive off that bitch and freefall towards the valley
below. I get the same full body tense-up that I got with the Tarzan swing and
once I catch my breath I let out a holler that reverberates throughout the canyon.
Our friends on the observation platform on the side of the hill said they could
hear me all the way over yonder.

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Stay till the end for a nice view of the valley</figcaption>

The initial freefall actually felt much shorter than I was expecting. The bungee
action was more of a slow build-up of tension on the cable and less of a snap
than I anticipated. The next few boings & drops were quite fun because I could
enjoy the views of the valley, hanging like a yo-yo. They send down the cable
and I strap myself in for the ride back up to the platform. That was the wildest
thing I've done in my life and the adrenaline is coursing through my veins.

So I don't really know what to do at this point. Nothing is going to top that.
We head back to town and I guess we'll go eat? While having a late lunch we
finally experience why this place is called the Cloud Forest when a thick fog
envelops the town. It was pretty cool to watch it roll through & I'm glad that
it didn't decide to show up until after our activities today.
