<h4 class="article-subheader">Tamarindo</h4>

The shuttle arrives to whisk us away to Tamarindo & we hop on a nearly full
van. I get the single seat right behind the sliding door so I have a decent
amount of room to stretch my legs for the 3 hour journey to the sea. After about
45 minutes of mountain views we drop down into the plains & I make a pretty good
dent in my book before we arrive.

It becomes quickly evident why some locals derisively call this place "Tamagringo."
It's the most touristy destination we've been to by a large margin, with high
end boutiques and ritzy accommodations sprinkled in between cafes and surf shops.
This town was founded on surfing but thrives on tourism. I'm not sure why this
particular town became the destination - maybe the waves are big enough but not
too big, maybe some developer had a stretch of real estate they needed developed,
who knows.

Whatever the case it looks like fun.

We jump off the shuttle at our hostel and lug our bags up to the reception area.
The pushy woman behind the counter enthusiastically
informs us that we can't check in until 2 PM, so we have a few hours to kill.
She finds it in her cold dark heart to let us drop our bags in the kitchen
until we check in
but you can tell she's annoyed by it. I make sure to take my time dropping my
things & because I can tell it's really irking her.

I remember that Tulsa should be playing Okie State right now - what better way
to kill a few hours than watch the Golden Hurricane bring the pain to those
pansies from Stillwater. I head down to Sharky's bar, a sports bar that I had
scoped out before coming to town that I thought would have the best chance at
showing the game. I plop down and they are able to pull it up & it's just after
halftime, Tulsa 7 - OSU 7.

Ok, we got a game on our hands.

I enjoy a few beers and watch TU blow the
game with a kick return TD in the 4th quarter. Tulsa continues to bring the
fight after that but that was the turning point. 23-28 Pokes final.

It's after 2 PM now so I walk back to the hostel to check in. The misearable woman
readies herself to dole out one of the 10-bed hostel dorms when I inform
her that I booked a private room. She asks who are the other people in my room
and I reply that it's just me.

"It has 3 beds" she says

"I don't give a shit, just give me the key" Andrew wishes he would have said.

"Ok? So...... Uh......" Andrew actually replies.

"It's just you?"

"Uh yeah"

"Okkkkk? Hmmmmm"

Don't give me that attitude. The room is $45/night, it's not like I'm a Saudi prince.
Leave your sour disposition at home and give me the key to my palace. You
really need more *Pura* in your *Vida*.

She hands me the key and leads me to the room, which has a full size bed and a
set of bunk beds. But the most important feature of the room is the A/C unit
on the wall. This will be my first night with air con, which I certainly can
oblige.

I throw on my trunks and head down to the beach for a quick run. A quick run
turns into a long run when my foot & knee that have been bothering me feel great.
Must be that moist Pacific breeze and soft sand beneath my feet. After the run I
decide to
grab a beer on the beach to rehydrate. They have a happy hour special for two
beers so I can't turn that down. Don't ask me how many Colones it cost.

After I finish the two beers (I later see that they have "all day happy hour," at
which point that's just the price. Alas) the sun is getting awfully close to the
horizon so I scoot down the beach to where I figure the folks from our hostel
will be. Sure enough they are there & I meet a new German girl and a fella named
Ryan from Philly with a couple pretty serious shiners under his eyes. He tells me
to get a fruit cocktail from a beachside vendor named Glenn and he'll tell me
the story. I get a mango & passion fruit rum cocktail from Glenn and it's
excellent. The perfect beverage for a Tamarindo sunset. Which should be the name
of a cocktail if it isn't already.

I amble back over to Ryan and he tells me that he was in Jaco a few days ago -
Jaco was the original Costa Rican tourist town on the Pacific coast and has since
been supplanted by Tamarindo and other towns on the Nicoya peninsula in the
competition for tourist
dollars - where he was walking home from a bar on the beach after dark and was
robbed. A guy came out of the shadows and smacked him over the head with a rock
and took his phone and all the money he had on him. Thankfully his passport and
most of his money was back at the hostel but without a phone it's tough to do
much these days - everything you login to sends a code to your phone to verify.

So he's waiting on his sister to wire him some money to Western Union, but of
course Western Union isn't open on the weekends (today is Saturday.. I think?) and
Monday is a national holiday. They also tell him that even when it's supposed to
be open it might not be open. And they might not have cash on hand. Because it's
Costa Rica and that's how they roll.

Moral of the story: don't walk on the beach after dark.

We all watch the sun set, painting the sky with a brilliant panoply of oranges,
blues, and purples. I'd quicker tell you the wavelengths
of all those different colors than write something poetic so I'll just let you
use your imagination. It's really magnificent.

After the sunset we walk back to the hostel where I meet an international couple -
guy from Spain and girl from Switzerland. We start chatting and I quickly learn
that they too just quit their job and started traveling. Fuckin A. Or whatever
you say in Spanish/German.

We add one more to the over-30 crew when the German girl we met on the beach
joins us. We have a great conversation about everyone's travels, including a
story about the German girl falling through a grate during a hike to some ruins
in Mexico that required a few dozen stitches in her leg. I ask for recommendations
in Europe when I decide to venture over the pond and they do likewise for
destinations in the US.

Levent and some other kids join us, including another German girl who learned English
in Australia. It's pretty hilarious to listen to her talk because she speaks
English with a full-on Aussie accent then when she starts speaking German all
the cheeky litheness of her Australian timbre immediately shifts to the harsh,
utilitarian sounds of her mother tongue.

The kids start talking about the big town party taking place that night. As their
plan coalesces they
ask the adults if we'd like to join but we demur, content to enjoy each others
company among some beers and bottles of wine.

After about an hour of aforementioned activities I hit the sack, ready for the
first NFL Sunday of the season.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Sunday Funday</h4>

I wake up feeling quite rested - the A/C was wonderful for inducing slumber. I
have a few hours till NFL kickoff so I head down to the beach for a run. Gotta
de-tox before I re-tox. After the run I head back to the hostel & get cleaned
up for the game.

This is the most hype the Bills have had to start a season since their 
heydey of the early 90s. They reached the AFC Championship last season and Big
Josh finished second in MVP voting. They made some seemingly shrewd offseason
moves and have their sights set on the Super Bowl. So I'm giddy.

I head to Sharky's and they have the game on and even have the audio. Let's Go
Buffalo. Isaiah McKenzie takes the opening kickoff down to the Pittsburgh 20
yard line and I think this is just the beginning of the ass whoopin.

Welp I was wrong.

Everything went downhill from there. The offense was anemic, the
playcalling was questionable, the penalties were plentiful. A blocked punt TD for
the Stillers really put the game away but the Bills really need more out of their
offense. 16 points for a team that averaged over 30 points a game just ain't
gonna cut it. At least the defense looked strong for most of the game. Oh well
it's a long season, just gotta trust the process.

I close out my tab, which was in the tens of thousands, could be $10 could be
$100, we'll see when I report my credit card stolen at the end of this trip
(kidding... sorta). I then violate Sharky's Covid Commandment #6 when I see a
woman sitting at a table by herself and shamelessly saunter up and begin
chatting.

I learn that Kaiti is a registered nurse in Sacramento originally from Lansing,
Michigan. She's on holiday for a week and came to Sharky's just to check in on
the NFL games. My kinda girl. I ask if she'd like to get a drink later and she
tells me she'll take that drink right now. I wish I could report that she did
that thing from the movies where she slid the chair out with her foot but in
actuality I awkwardly shuffled into the chair while trying to unload my backpack
on another chair.

She's staying at the Westin, an all-inclusive resort about 30 minutes north of
here. They have shuttles that run into town a few times a day, presumably 
for the guests to dispossess
themselves of greenbacks in exchange for cute beach dresses, designer flip-flops,
and assorted Costa Rican themed tchotchkes.

We throw back a few brewskis and discuss our respective trips.
She actually majored in Spanish as an undergrad then pivoted to nursing for
her graduate studies and career. She's been to Costa Rica a few times before
and can't help but coming back.

A few more Imperials and it's getting close to sunset. There's only one thing
to do at sunset, head down to the beach. On the way we stop at the supermarket
for a bottle of wine and venture down to the same spot as yesterday. We meet our
friends and enjoy the sunset like a bunch of heathens.

After the sun goes down Kaiti and I walk to an Asian fusion joint for some
sushi. I see they have a special for 3 oysters and a glass of wine that I just
can't resist. I've never had warm water Pacific oysters so I need to try them.
They weren't bad - they were certainly better than gulf oysters - but they
weren't *inspired*.

In contrast the unagi roll and yellowfin nigiri were outstanding. We are just
finishing our meals when the lights go out. What the hell. The owner of the
restaurant comes around and tells us that we're getting close to the 10 PM curfew
so they need to start shutting down or else the cops will fine them. I ask if
there is a store open past 10 that we can snag some beers or wine from and she
assures us that the supermercardo down the road is open till 10:30. Excellent.

We pay up then head to the store to pick up some refreshments and there is a
surly security guard out front who tells us in whatever language you want that
they are closed.

Well shit.

I would have scampered down here for some booze before 10 had we not received
false intel from the restaurant owner. Miss Kaiti and I are
lamenting our bad fortune as we're walking aimlessly through the streets of
Tamarindo when we find our hero: Lady on the Corner.

We are walking along minding our own business when we hear from a woman sitting
on a bucket,

"Hola mis amigos, you need a beer?"

Do we? It's funny you should ask because that's exactly what we need.

We walk over to Lady on the Corner and order 6 beers. She disappears for a bit
then returns with 4 Cezkas (still have no idea where the hell they are
from) and 2 Busch Lights. If I'm buying loose beers from a woman sitting on a
bucket in Costa Rica you bet your ass I want them to be Busch Lights. Hell yes.

We head back towards where Ryan is staying - he said
they have a nice balcony to hang out on so we test his theory. The theory is
indeed sound. The balcony is pretty sweet and I enjoy my black market Busch
Light while speaking broken Spanish to Jason, a Tico who for the moment will
put up with my butchering of his mother tongue. We also meet Esteban, another
Tico who we learn lived in Poland for 4 years. We ask
him how he ended up there and he says that he wanted to live in Europe and just
chose Poland.

*What?*

Now I love my Polish brothers and sisters and I'm sure they have a beautiful
country but I wouldn't think it would be the first place that someone would
choose to live in Europe. I keep pressing him on how he chose Poland - any family
connections? Do you like the history? The food? The people? Did someone recommend
it to you? And really has no good reason. He just picked Poland. Wild.

I ask him if he speaks Polish and he says no. He lived in Poland for 4 years and
never learned Polish. What a bizarre situation. He loved it apart from the
winters but I still can't wrap my head around how it came to be. Esteban you are
a wonderful maniac.

Once we run out of our "Lady on the Corner" beers, Ryan gets a jonesin for a
dart. Well Ryan, do I know a place you can acquire a loose cigarette. I tell
him about Lady on the Corner, LLC and for some reason I break into an
incontrollable laugh every time someone says "Lady on the Corner." I am
telling him about her bespoke establishment and can't complete my sentence
because I'm a wee bit high. Oh yeah, in addition to my favorite European travel
story Esteban also has some pretty good pot. Pura Vida.

Kaiti and I (Lady on the Corner vets) waltz confidently to through a series
of boring corners until we get to THE corner. Our hero, *Lady on the Corner*, is
standing guard over her domain & when she sees us return she gives us the full
Tica welcome. I order another beer apiece for Kaiti and me and Ryan gets to
hagglin' over the price of a dart. It must be the Philly in him but he argues
her down to a price that
sounds like a lot lower than her original price but he probably saved himself
a nickel. I don't know how much 3 loose cigarettes cost in Costa Rica but I
know how much he paid.

We walk back to the balcony and enjoy the rest of the night. The Pacific coast
has a different pace than I've been accustomed to.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Kowabunga</h4>

I arise in a much cheerier mood than I expected given my Busch Light nightcap
and head down to the beach. Maybe we'll give this whole surf thing a whirl. I
sample the market around town and a surf lesson seems to be running
$40-60 depending on your vendor. I start walking down to the fella who quoted me
$40 when a guy who probably can spot a gringo in need of a surf lesson
from a nautical mile away and asks me if I want to go surfing.

I ask how much and he replies with a confident "thirty five dollars mi
amigo, pura vida." Well hot damn, you have yourself a deal. And whom do I have the
pleasure of doing business with?

"Tarzan"

Hell yes. I'm going to learn how to rip barrels from a guy named Tarzan. I
wouldn't want it any other way. Between the coffee tour with Geronimo and a surf
lesson with Tarzan Costa Rica has blessed me with some pretty kickass names.
Tarzan grabs a board and gives me a crash course on the beach and
I can already tell this ain't gonna be easy. It seems limberness is an attribute
that would benefit a surfer I have the flexibility of a middle
aged woman at Starbucks when they run out of caramel for her macchiato. I try to
nail the technique a half dozen times and each time Tarzan tells me I'm not doing
the thing he just told me to do. I'm laughing my ass off because it's hilarious
how bad I am as this and Tarzan eventually gets tired of repeating himself and
relents.

"Ok let's go surf"

My thoughts exactly, Tarzan.

We walk out into the surf and the waves are coming in pretty good. Or at least I
think they are. I've never done this before so who the hell knows. The nice
thing about where we are is the waves are breaking around waist-deep to chest-deep
water. So Tarzan can stand there and line me up on the surfboard and give me a
push like a dad teaching a kid how to ride a bike. He sees a wave he likes and
gives me a shove. And I fail spectacularly. In an instant. Well dadgum.

Let's give it another go. And another. And another.

I try about a half dozen times without even the slightest resemblance to what
anyone would call "surfing." And then just like that Tarzan gives me a shove
and I pop up! I looked like a baby giraffe standing up but I got up! And then
fell. I might have made it 3 seconds but I was up for a bit. A few more wipeouts,
a few more successful attempts of increasing length.

I eventually rack up about 3-4 times where I stay up for an extended period of time
and actually surf. I mean I had no idea how to turn and was wobblier than a frat
boy at 3 AM but I surfed I guess? It was fun when it worked but it was a damn
workout. After a little over an hour of displays of mediocre athleticism I fall
off in pretty shallow water and land a bit funny on my ankle. It didn't really
hurt it was just awkward. I took that as a sign that the ocean had endured
enough of my feeble attempts at recreation and I decide to call it a day. We'll
just keep it at "almost injured" instead of "broken ankle in Costa Rica."

We walk back up to Tarzan's tent where I drop my board and find Kaiti waiting
for me at the bar with a glass of cold, refreshing sangria wine. I thought she
had a shuttle to catch a few hours ago but I guess it was delayed so she
decided to come watch me make a fool of myself. We laugh about it all, mostly
about the golf-ball sized rash on my stomach from rubbing on the surfboard.

Since the first sangria wine was so tasty we decide it would be best to have
another. Whoa-oooooh-ooh-ooooh-oooooooah I love sangria wine!

<h4 class="article-subheader">Well That Escalated Quickly</h4>

We finish our glasses and it's time for her shuttle back to the Westin. We make
the short walk to the pickup point and while waiting for the van a guy starts
talking at us. He asks us where we're from and informs us that he was born
in Costa Rica, grew up in Miami, where he never got his citizenship, and was
deported about 5 years ago. Kaiti's ride shows up and she is mercifully spared
from our new conversational hijacker.

It's supper time and I try to break away to grab some grub but he dives into his
life story. It's a tale full of drugs, gangs, fights, and jail time. I really
just want to tell him to have a nice day but now I don't want to anger him. I
keep listening and he tells me he had gotten his life in order, had a wife and
two boys, and it all fell apart when he lost a son in a house fire in Miami. It's
pretty heartbreaking and I
think he just wanted someone to talk to. Maybe he wanted to talk to me because I
looked like Jesus. In any case he details the dark paths that he went down that
led him to his current situation, deported from the US, hustling to make it in
Costa Rica. He really doesn't want to be here but it's the hand he's played.

Now he's seeming to wind down his story and I will be able to peel off for some
food and a beer when the entire situation takes a turn. An insane turn that I
wouldn't believe if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes. We were talking in the
main area of town, a well lit intersection with dozens of tourists about and in
front of a popular open-air Argentinian restaurant. A place that you wouldn't
expect what's about to happen.

Out of nowhere like a bat out of hell
a long haired dude charges up and starts attacking the guy I'm talking to
with a machete taped up with newspaper - presumably with the intention to maim
instead of kill.

That's right, the guy gets attacked with a machete in the
busiest section of the most touristy town in Costa Rica. I look at all the other
gringos on the square and we give each other knowing glances of horror and
confusion. If you could convert the look on our faces to English I believe it
would be something akin to *what the fuck is going on?*

The assailant strikes about half a dozen blows before they tumble out onto the
dimly lit beach. I stand where I'm at for a few minutes completely dumbfounded,
not really knowing what to do. Everyone else gets back to their mulling about
and since I had nothing better to do I joined them in the mulling. I end up
plopping down at El Mercadito, an open-air food hall right next to the
Argentinian restaurant. I'm still trying to process what just happened and after
a few minutes I decide I guess I'll eat something?

I order a steak sandwich named after Leonel Messi and grab a beer from the bar
in the center of the market. I stay for another beer and walk back towards
Sharky's, where a couple Costa Rican girls said there should be a fun crowd. On
my way over there I see the machete victim walking down the street looking worse
for wear. He's got some pretty serious gashes on his head, neck, arms, and ribs.

I tell him he needs to get stitched up and he says all the clinics are closed &
he doesn't have any money for cab fare to get back home. Jesus. I snag the few
bucks I have in my pocket and ask him if that will do the trick and he says it
will work. I dip into the grocery store just before it closes and get him some
rubbing alcohol, Tylenol, and cotton swabs. They didn't have any neosporin or
bandages so it's the best I could do.

He thanks me profusely and tells me as I dump him into a cab that I've got a
friend for life. So, uh, I
guess if anybody needs some shady shit done in Costa Rica I have a guy? By now
it's after the 10 PM curfew and everything is closed down. I walk back to my
accommodation and try to get some sleep, it's a little difficult to wind down
after tonight's wild events but I eventually get some shuteye. Costa freakin
Rica.

The next day is significantly less eventful than yesterday. After a run on the
beach and breakfast/coffee I head down to rent a board from Tarzan. I had the
lesson yesterday so let's take the training wheels off and see if I can do this
on my own. Spoiler alert: I can't.

I try unsuccessfully to stand up for an hour, I get almost up a couple times,
a kind of half-squat half-take-a-knee position that I couldn't transition to a
full stand. The waves are a bit bigger today and it's even more of a workout
than yesterday. Plus my board is smaller and much more unstable.
I think Tarzan gives folks the big, stable board while he's giving lessons then
a small wobbly board when they want to rent the board alone so they'll go back
to pay more for a lesson. This is just my theory and if it's true I
love the ingenuity. Tarzan is a hustler.

I try and try and try some more then decide to call it a day when my left
shoulder gets a little squirrely on a paddle stroke. This is the shoulder I
dislocated skiing in February and I definitely don't want to deal with that
again. I tip my cap to the ocean and walk off to surf another day.

The afternoon is spent reading and relaxing on the beach. I see the Costa Rican
girls again tonight and meet up with them and two Spanish girls at El Pacifico
after supper for some beers and reggae. The party ends just as it's getting
started due to the curfew and everyone disperses out on the street. As I'm
walking back home I bump into Esteban. We order a few beers from our old friend,
Lady on the Corner, and he tells me about his coffee venture that he's been
working on.

He's a coffee connoisseur and quit his job to try his hand at building
a specialty coffee company. He's been working on building relationships with
suppliers of beans from Tarraz&eacute;, one of Costa Rica's most famous coffee
growing regions. He's in Tamarindo trying to get coffee shops to buy his beans,
with limited success. He's a coffee purist and the quality of the coffee he
wants to provide is not yet appreciated by the masses. I think it's similar to
the early stages of the craft beer boom, where people didn't know what they
didn't know about good beer. People are used to their run-of-the-mill commodity
coffee and don't know what they are missing with specialty coffees. It's a tough
racket but I can see the passion he has for his coffee. He tells me we can try
out his joe at Tamarindo Coffee Roasters tomorrow.
Sounds good to me. We head back to our respective domiciles and call it a night.

The next morning Esteban picks me up and we head to try out his coffee. Esteban
has made friends with the owners and baristas at Tamarindo Coffee Roasters, who
he says has the best coffee in the area. We head to the back room where he shows
me their roaster that they allow him to use to roast his beans. He pulls out
a tub of his beans and gives them a big ol whiff. It's been 4 days since he
roasted them and he says they have gotten a bit sweeter every day. This is a
medium body, medium acidity, medium roast coffee that should be pretty approachable.

Esteban weighs out some beans and then we take them back to the front to brew.
He readies up a Chemex and tells me the proper technique for preparing it. Once
done he pours me a cup and we give it a try. He tells me all the tasting notes:
citrus, dried fruit, and some floral notes, but my unrefined palate only comes
to the conclusion that this is
damn fine coffee. I mention that it's not as hot as most coffee I've had, which
allows me to taste a fuller complement of flavors. He laughs and says that most
coffee is served so hot because it's shit. Good coffee should be served at a
temperature where it's not scalding your mouth and you can actually taste it.
Makes sense to me.

We finish the coffee and as we're about to leave Esteban tells me about
C&aacute;scara, a tea made from the
dried skins of coffee cherries. He had a bag already opened and he reaches in
and scoops out a fistful and pops a few right in his mouth. I follow suit
and they tasted like a mix between dried plums & cherries. It was quite tasty
so I decided to buy a bag as we were leaving.

Esteban drops me off back in Tamarindo where I head to the main square for a
collectivo - an informal taxi that's essentially just a guy with a car that you
negotiate a price for transport. I'm headed up to the Westin, Kaiti said they
have day passes and invited me to spend a day living the life of luxury. Sounds
like a damn good deal to me, let's get fancy.
