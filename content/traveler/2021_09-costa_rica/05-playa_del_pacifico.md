The shuttle arrives to whisk us away to Tamarindo & we hop on to a nearly full
van-bus. I get the single seat right behind the sliding door so I have a decent
amount of room to stretch my legs for the 3 hour journey to the sea. After about
45 minutes of mountain views we drop down into the plains & I make a pretty good
dent in my book before we arrive in Tamarindo.

It becomes quickly evident why some locals derisively call this place "Tamagringo."
It's the most touristy destination we've been to by a large margin, with high
end boutiques and ritzy accommodations sprinkled in between cafes and surf shops.
This town was founded on surfing but thrives on tourism. I'm not sure why this
particular town became the destination - maybe the waves are big enough but not
too big, maybe Big Bob Pitaki had a stretch of real estate he needed developed,
who knows.

Irregardless it looks like fun.

We jump off the shuttle at our hostel and lug our bags up to the reception area.
The pushy woman behind the counter enthusiastically
informs us that we can't check in until 2 PM, so we have a few hours to kill.
She finds it in her cold dark heart to let us drop our bags in the kitchen
until we check in
but you can tell she's annoyed by it. I make sure to take my time dropping my
things & because I can tell it's really irking her.

I remember that Tulsa should be playing Okie State right now - what better way
to kill a few hours than watch the Golden Hurricane bring the pain to those
pansies from Stillwater. I head down to Sharky's bar, a sports bar that I had
scoped out before coming to town that I thought would have the best chance at
showing the game. I plop down and they are able to pull it up & it's just after
halftime, Tulsa 7 - OSU 7.

Ok, we got a game on our hands.

I enjoy a few beers and watch TU blow the
game with a kick return TD in the 4th quarter. Tulsa continues to bring the
fight after that but that was the turning point. 23-28 Pokes final.

It's after 2 PM now so I walk back to the hostel to check in. The misearable woman
readies herself to dole out one of the 10-bed hostel dorms when I inform
her that I booked a private room. She asks who are the other people in my room
and I reply that it's just me.

"It has 3 beds" she says

"I don't give a fuck" Andrew wishes he would have said.

"Ok? So...... Uh......" Andrew actually replies.

"It's just you?"

"Uh yeah"

"Okkkkk? Hmmmmm"

Don't give me that shit. Leave your fucking 'tude at home and give me the key to
my palace. Get some more Pura in your Vida. 

I have to say that we're talking 


I get settled in & the room has A/C! King of the castle king of the castle!

I throw on my trunks and head down to the beach for a quick run. A quick run
turns into a long run when my foot & knee that have been bothering me feel great.
Must be that moist Pacific breeze and soft sand beneath my feet. I decide to
grab a beer on the beach to rehydrate and they have a happy hour special for two
beers so I can't turn that down. Don't ask me how many Colones it cost.

After I finish the two beers (I later see that they have "all day happy hour," at
which point that's just the price. Alas) the sun is getting awfully close to the
horizon so I scoot down the beach to where I figure the folks from our hostel
will be. Sure enough they are there & I meet a new German girl and a fella named
Ryan from Philly with a couple pretty serious shiners under his eyes. He tells me
to get a fruit cocktail from a beachside vendor named Glenn and he'll tell me
the story. I get a mango & passion fruit rum cocktail from Glenn and it's just
what the doctor ordered.

I saunter back over to Ryan and he tells me that he was in Jaco a few days ago -
Jaco was the original Costa Rican tourist town on the Pacific coast and has since
been supplanted by Tamarindo and other towns on the Nicoya peninsula for tourist
dollars - where he was walking home from a bar on the beach after dark and was
robbed. A guy came out of the shadows and smacked him over the head with a rock
and took his phone and all the money he had on him. Thankfully his passport and
most of his money was back at the hostel but without a phone it's tough to do
much these days - everything you login to sends a code to your phone to verify.

So he's waiting on his sister to wire him some money to Western Union, but of
course Western Union isn't open on the weekends (it's Saturday right now) and
Monday is a national holiday. They also tell him that even when it's supposed to
be open it might not be open. And they might not have cash on hand. Because it's
Costa Rica and that's how they roll.

Moral of the story: don't walk on the beach after dark.

We all watch the sun set, painting the sky with a brilliant panoply of oranges,
blues, and purples. I'd quicker tell you the wavelengths
of all those different colors than write something poetic so I'll just let you
use your imagination. It's really magnificent.

After the sunset we walk back to the hostel where I meet an international couple -
guy from Spain and girl from Switzerland. We start chatting and I quickly learn
that they too just quit their job and started traveling. Fuckin A. Or whatever
you say in Spanish/German.

We add one more to the over-30 crew when the German girl we met on the beach
joins us. We have a great conversation about everyone's travels, including a
story about the German girl falling through a grate during a hike to some ruins
in Mexico that required a few dozen stitches in her leg. I ask for recommendations
in Europe when I decide to venture over the pond and they do likewise for
destinations in the US.

Levent and some other kids join us, including another German girl who learned English
in Australia. It's pretty hilarious to listen to her talk because she speaks
English with a full-on Aussie accent then when she starts speaking German all
the cheeky litheness of her Australian timbre immediately shifts to the harsh,
utilitarian sounds of her mother tongue.

The kids start talking about the big town party taking place that night & they
ask the adults if we'd like to join but we demur, content to enjoy each others
company among some beers and bottles of wine.

I hit the sack, ready for the first NFL Sunday of the season.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Sunday Funday</h4>

I wake up feeling quite rested, the A/C was wonderful for inducing slumber. I
have a few hours till NFL kickoff so I head down to the beach for a run. Gotta
de-tox before I re-tox. After the run I head back to the hostel & get cleaned
up for the game.

This is the most hype the Bills have had to start a season since the Super Bowl
heydey of the early 90s. They reached the AFC Championship last season and Big
Josh finished second in MVP voting. They made some seemingly shrewd offseason
moves and have their sights set on the Super Bowl. So I'm giddy.

I head to Sharky's and they have the game on and even have the audio. Let's Go
Buffalo. Isaiah McKenzie takes the opening kickoff down to the Pittsburgh 20
yard line and I think this is just the beginning of the ass whoopin.

Welp I was wrong.

Everything went downhill from that initial kick. The offense was sputtering, the
playcalling was questionable, the penalties were bountiful. A blocked punt TD for
the Stillers really put the game away but they really need more out of their
offense. 16 points for a team that averaged over 30 points a game just ain't
gonna cut it. At least the defense looked strong for most of the game. Oh well
it's a long season, just gotta trust the process.

I close out my tab, which was in the tens of thousands, could be $10 could be
$100, we'll see when I report my credit card stolen at the end of this trip
(kidding... sorta). I then violate Sharky's Covid Commandment #6 when I see a
woman sitting at a table by herself and shamelessly saunter up and begin
chatting.

I learn that Kaiti is a registered nurse in Sacramento originally from Lansing,
Michigan. She's on holiday for a week and came to Sharky's just to check in on
the NFL games. My kinda girl. I ask if she'd like to get a drink later and she
tells me she'll take that drink right now so I join her at her table.

She's staying at the Westin, an all-inclusive resort about 30 minutes north of
here. They have shuttles that run into town a few times a day, presumably 
for the guests to dispossess
themselves of greenbacks in exchange for cute beach dresses, designer flip-flops,
and assorted Costa Rican themed tchotchkes.

We throw back a few brewskis and discuss the journey that has brought us here.
She actually majored in Spanish as an undergrad then pivoted to nursing for
her graduate studies and career. She's been to Costa Rica a few times before
and can't help but coming back.

A few more Imperials and it's getting close to sunset. There's only one thing
to do at sunset, head down to the beach. On the way we stop at the supermarket
for a bottle of wine and venture down to the same spot as yesterday. We meet our
friends and enjoy the sunset like a bunch of heathens.

After the sun goes down Kaiti and I walk to an Asian fusion joint for some
sushi. I see they have a special for 3 oysters and a glass of wine that I just
can't resist. I've never had warm water Pacific oysters so I need to try them.
They weren't bad - they were certainly better than gulf oysters - but they
weren't *inspired*. I'll probably try Costa Rica oysters again if/when I come
down here again but I don't think they'll be at the top of my list.

In contrast the unagi roll and yellowfin nigiri were outstanding. We are just
finishing our meals when the lights go out. What the hell. The owner of the
restaurant comes around and tells us that we're getting close to the 10 PM curfew
so they need to start shutting down or else the cops will fine them. I ask if
there is a store open past 10 that we can snag some beers or wine from and she
assures us that the supermercardo down the road is open till 10:30. Excellent.

We pay up then head to the store to pick up some refreshments and there is a
surly security guard out front who tells us in whatever language you want that
they are closed.

Well shit.

I would have scampered down here for some booze before 10 had we not received
some false intel from the sushi restaurant owner lady. Miss Kaiti and I are
lamenting our bad fortune as we're walking aimlessly through the streets of
Tamarindo when we find our hero.

Lady on the corner.

We are walking along minding our own business when a woman sitting on a bucket
gives us a

"hey, you need a beer?"

Do I?

We walk up to Lady on the Corner and order 6 beers. She disappears for a bit
then returns with 4 Cezkas (still have no idea where the hell those beers are
from) and 2 Busch Lights. If I'm buying loose beers from a woman sitting on a
bucket in Costa Rica you bet your ass I want them to be Busch Lights. Fuckin A.

We head back towards where our friend Ryan who was mugged is staying - he said
they have a nice balcony to hang out on so we test his theory. The theory is
indeed sound. The balcony is pretty sweet and I enjoy my black market Busch
Light while speaking broken Spanish to Jason, a Tico who for the moment will
put up with my butchering of his mother tongue.

Once we run out of our "Lady on the Corner" beers, Ryan gets a jonesin for a
dart. Well Ryan, do I know a place you can acquire a loose cigarette. I tell
him about Lady on the Corner, LLC and for some reason I break into an
incontrollable laugh every time someone says "Lady on the Corner." I am
telling him about her bespoke establishment and can't complete my sentence
because I'm so high.  I mean, not high.. How do you say your friends have good
pot... Oh high? Yeah I'm pretty high

Lady on the corner

Kaiti and I (Lady on the corner veterans) waltz confidently to through a series
of boring corners until we get to THE corner. Our hero, *Lady on the Corner*, is
standing guard over her domain & when she sees us return she gives us the full
Tica welcome. I order another beer apiece for Kaiti and me and Ryan gets to
hagglin' over the price of a dart. It must be the Philly in him but he argues
her down to a price that
sounds like a lot lower than her original price but he probably saved himself
a nickel. I don't know how much 3 loose cigarettes cost in Costa Rica but I
know how much he paid.

We walk back to the balcony and enjoy the rest of the night. The Pacific coast
has a different pace than I've been accustomed to.
