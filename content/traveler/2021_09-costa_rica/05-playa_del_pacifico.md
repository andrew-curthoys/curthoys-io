The shuttle arrives to whisk us away to Tamarindo & we hop on to a nearly full
bus. I get the single seat right behind the sliding door so I have a decent
amount of room to stretch my legs for the 3 hour journey to the sea. After about
45 minutes of mountain views we drop down into the plains & I make a pretty good
dent in my book before we arrive in Tamarindo.

It becomes quickly evident why some locals derisively call this place "Tamagringo."
It's the most touristy destination we've been to by a large margin, with high
end boutiques and ritzy accommodations sprinkled in between cafes and surf shops.
We jump off the shuttle at our hostel with a couple girls from Israel.

(Sidebar: we've seen an inordinate amount of Israelis - the reason being they
typically travel after completing their compulsory 2-year military service.
Almost every Israeli we see has just completed his/her military service & there
are so many in Costa Rica because it's one of the most open destinations for
travel Covid-wise.)

We lug our bags up to the reception area and the pushy woman behind the counter
informs us that we can't check in until 2 PM. So we have a few hours to kill.
She finds it in her cold dark heart to let us drop our bags until check in time,
but you can tell she's annoyed by it. I make sure to take my time dropping my
things & grabbing what I need, I can tell it's really irking her.

I remember that Tulsa should be playing Okie State right now - what better way
to kill a few hours than watch the Golden Hurricane bring the pain to those
pansies from Stillwater. I head down to Sharky's bar, a sports bar that I had
scoped out before coming to town that I thought would have the best chance at
showing the game. I plop down and they are able to pull it up & it's just after
halftime, Tulsa 7 - OSU 7.

Alright, we got a game on our hands. I enjoy a few beers and watch TU blow the
game with a kick return TD in the 4th quarter. Tulsa continues to bring the
fight after that but that was the turning point. 23-28 Pokes final.

It's after 2 now so I walk back to the hostel to check in. The terrible woman is
shocked when I tell her that I have booked a private room for myself. Just give
me the key & leave your fucking 'tude at home. She needs some more pura in her
vida.

I get settled in & the room has A/C! King of the castle king of the castle!

I throw on my trunks and head down to the beach for a quick run. A quick run
turns into a long run when my foot & knee that have been bothering me feel great.
Must be that moist Pacific breeze and soft sand beneath my feet. I decide to
grab a beer on the beach to rehydrate and they have a happy hour special for two
beers so I can't turn that down. Don't ask me how many Colones it cost.

After I finish the two beers (I later see that they have "all day happy hour," at
which point that's just the price. Alas) the sun is getting awfully close to the
horizon so I scoot down the beach to where I figure the folks from our hostel
will be. Sure enough they are there & I meet a new German girl and a fella named
Ryan from Philly with a couple pretty serious shiners under his eyes. He tells me
to get a fruit cocktail from a beachside vendor named Glenn and he'll tell me
the story. I get a mango & passion fruit rum cocktail from Glenn and it's just
what the doctor ordered.

I saunter back over to Ryan and he tells me that he was in Jaco a few days ago -
Jaco was the original Costa Rican tourist town on the Pacific coast and has since
been supplanted by Tamarindo and other towns on the Nicoya peninsula for tourist
dollars - where he was walking home from a bar on the beach after dark and was
robbed. A guy came out of the shadows and smacked him over the head with a rock
and took his phone and all the money he had on him. Thankfully his passport and
most of his money was back at the hostel but without a phone it's tough to do
much these days - everything you login to sends a code to your phone to verify.

So he's waiting on his sister to wire him some money to Western Union, but of
course Western Union isn't open on the weekends (it's Saturday right now) and
Monday is a national holiday. They also tell him that even when it's supposed to
be open it might not be open. And they might not have cash on hand. Because it's
Costa Rica and that's how they roll.

Moral of the story: don't walk on the beach after dark.

We all watch the sun set, painting the sky with a brilliant panoply of oranges,
blues, and purples. I'd quicker tell you the wavelengths
of all those different colors than write something poetic so I'll just let you
use your imagination. It's really magnificent.

After the sunset we walk back to the hostel where I meet an international couple -
guy from Spain and girl from Switzerland. We start chatting and I quickly learn
that they too just quit their job and started traveling. Fuckin A. Or whatever
you say in Spanish/German.

We add one more to the over-30 crew when the German girl we met on the beach
joins us. We have a great conversation about everyone's travels, including a
story about the German girl falling through a grate during a hike to some ruins
in Mexico that required a few dozen stitches in her leg. I ask for recommendations
in Europe when I decide to venture over the pond and they do likewise for
destinations in the US.

Levent and some other kids join us, including another German girl who learned English
in Australia. It's pretty hilarious to listen to her talk because she speaks
English with a full-on Aussie accent then when she starts speaking German all
the cheeky litheness of her Australian timbre immediately shifts to the harsh,
utilitarian sounds of her mother tongue.

The kids start talking about the big town party taking place that night & they
ask the adults if we'd like to join but we demur, content to enjoy each others
company among some beers and bottles of wine.

I hit the sack, ready for the first NFL Sunday of the season.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Sunday Funday</h4>
I wake up feeling quite rested, the A/C was wonderful for inducing slumber. I
have a few hours till NFL kickoff so I head down to the beach for a run. Gotta
de-tox before I re-tox. After the run I head back to the hostel & get cleaned
up for the game.

This is the most hype the Bills have had to start a season since the Super Bowl
heydey of the early 90s. They reached the AFC Championship last season and Big
Josh finished second in MVP voting. They made some seemingly shrewd offseason
moves and have their sights set on the Super Bowl. So I'm giddy.

I head to Sharky's and they have the game on and even have the audio. Let's Go
Buffalo. Isaiah McKenzie takes the opening kickoff down to the Pittsburgh 20
yard line and I think this is just the beginning of the ass whoopin.

Welp I was wrong.

Everything went downhill from that initial kick. The offense was sputtering, the
playcalling was questionable, the penalties were bountiful. A blocked punt TD for
the Stillers really put the game away but they really need more out of their
offense. 16 points for a team that averaged over 30 points a game just ain't
gonna cut it. At least the defense looked strong for most of the game. Oh well
it's a long season, just gotta trust the process.
