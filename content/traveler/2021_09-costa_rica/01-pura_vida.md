"We gotta turn around"

We were a mile from the house & realized I forgot my Spanish-English pocket
dictionary. That might be useful with my rudimentary grasp of the Spanish
language. Not sure if you know this but they have a different word for everything.

Timmy whips the car around and a block or two later I find the book in a separate 
pocket of my backpack.

"Ahhhh never mind, I found it. My bad"

And just like that we're back on schedule. It was only a minor detour and a
minute later we're on the highway and cruisin.

Until we weren't.

"Oh shit. We do actually have to turn around"

This time we were a mile from the airport and I realized I had left my proof
of vaccination form sitting on my desk. Yeah I'm definitely gonna need that.

Yikes

Luckily everywhere in Tulsa is 15 minutes from the airport and about half an
hour later we're right back at Tulsa International. This time with proper
documentation.

Timmy drops me off right at 7:50. My flight is at 9:00. Anyone currently reading
in a big city is probably growing anxious at this point.

I breeze up to a United kiosk, type in my reservation number, flash my
vaccine form, and I'm through security by 7:55. No joke. The Tulsa airport is
amazing. I'm at my gate by 8:00 with 30 minutes to spare before boarding.

Glad I had enough time for my little detour.

The flight to Houston is short & uneventful. I make my way to Terminal E and have to
show my vaccine form once again at the gate. I get on the bird and I'm ready to
set my watch to Pura Vida standard time.

Only one small problem, the flight crew isn't here yet. Their flight getting to
Houston was delayed and we have to wait on them. After about 20 minutes the
pilot shows up in a cheery mood and lets us know that we're all set to go.

Except one more small thing. There's some weather in Costa Rica and the captain
wants to top off the gas tanks in case we have any difficulties getting in.
He relayed this information to the fuel crews 20 minutes ago when he landed (at
least that's his story, he seemed like a good guy so I'll believe him) but
something got lost in translation and the fuel crew never got the message.

Another 30 minutes waiting on the fuel crew and we are finally ready to push
back. We're about an hour behind schedule, but honestly I have nowhere to be.
I'm on holiday.

And when I say I have nowhere to be, I really mean it. I booked a flight to
Costa Rica and a return flight 3 weeks later. That's it. Well, actually while we
were delayed I caved and booked a hostel for tonight in San Jos&eacute; that was
well rated and allegedly in a quiet neighborhood. But other than that, no plans
whatsoever. Let's see where the winds take me.

<h4 class="article-subheader">San Jos&eacute;</h4>

I land in San Jos&eacute; and zip through Immigration and Customs - I guess that's
one of the perks of coming during the slow season. I depart the airport and
expect some sort of cafe where I can grab a bite and a cold beer. Instead I'm
assaulted by people trying to get me to use their cab service. Since there is
nowhere to eat I dump myself into a cab and head to the hostel. It's about 45
minutes through some shit traffic before I finally arrive at In The Winds hostel
in the San Pedro neighborhood of San Jos&eacute;.

The proprietor gives me the tour
of the joint and suggests a few places I can grab a bite. I drop my bags and
head to the closest one, a blend of Costa Rican, Peruvian, and Japanese food. I
end up ordering the arroz con pollo and warsh it down with a
ginger ale. Something about a soda out of a glass bottle just hits different.

I then make my way to Fito's Bar and enjoy a few beers* while reading a
hard-boiled detective novel that my good friend and consigliere Will gave me in
Boston last weekend at 3 AM.
After that it's back to the hostel and I turn in for an early night.

\* All beers referenced herein are Imperials (a damn fine Costa Rican beer brand)
unless otherwise noted.

The next morning I wake up and plan to check out a few museums in the city that I've read about.
The hostel has freshly brewed coffee and they whip up an enormous pancake that I
shouldn't have finished but I did anyway because it was so damn good.

While at desayuno
I meet a fella from northern Spain and another guy from Cuba. The Cuban guy is
in the middle of a journey headed for the US - he started in Venezuela, made his
way through Colombia & Panama and now he's about to set out through Nicaragua,
Honduras, Guatemala, and a long trek through Mexico. It's pretty humbling to see
the sacrifice that someone will go through to achieve what we take for granted.

My friend from Cuba has to take a phone call and I wish him luck on his travels.
Just as I'm about
to head back to my room a fellow traveler plops down next to me at the
breakfast table. I grab another cup of coffee and we strike up a conversation.
C&eacute;cile is from the west of France and has been traveling through Mexico
for a month and arrived in Costa Rica the day before I did. She just finished
her Masters in Civil Engineering at 2 AM the night before on a video call with
Paris so she's operating somewhere in the tired/excited/relieved space.

While we're talking another girl from Switzerland sits down for a pancake & a
cup of coffee. C&eacute;cile & Mia begin chatting and it turns out
they're both headed to Puerto Viejo, a small town on the Caribbean coast that
they've heard great things about. I hadn't considered making my way to the
Caribbean on this trip but fuck it - I ain't got nothin else to do. I
ask if they mind if I tag along and they are amenable to add a third to their
newly founded travel party. Mia checks her
watch & we have 15 minutes until we need to catch a cab to the bus terminal and
I am not packed in the slightest.
I sprint upstairs and throw all my shit into my bag as quickly as possible
and meet them in the lobby with a minute to spare. We pile into the cab and
off we go to the bus terminal.

Let the adventure begin...
