summary: 

I flag down a collectivo and talk him down to $20 for a trip to the Westin. We
spend most of the 30 minute drive speaking broken Spanish, mostly about Costa
Rica and soccer and Costa Rican soccer. We get to Brasilito and he pulls over
to drop me off. I tell
him I'm headed to the Westin & he tells me that you can't get in there unless
you have authorization. I then tell him that I'm meeting someone there and we
should be good, at which point he tells me that you can't get in there unless
you have authorization. I tell him again that I'm meeting someone and I'm sure
you can guess what he says next.

He tells me I can walk down the beach a bit, over a small rocky peninsula, then
I'll be at Playa Conchal, which fronts the Westin. I hop out and follow his
instructions, down the beach, over the rocky promontory, and I find myself on
a stunning white sand beach.

Playa Conchal, translated as "beach of shells" is aptly named, as the sand is made of
millions of crushed shells (coarse grained, moderately sorted, sub-angular shell
fragments for all you geologists out there). It is considered one of the most
beautiful beaches in Costa Rica, which makes sense why the Westin decided to
locate here.

I walk a bit down the beach then find the back entrance to the resort and
scoot right in with all the confidence of a mediocre white male. I start
wandering towards where I imagine the front desk would be when I find an
unsecured guest wifi network near a coffee shop. I send Kaiti
a WhatsApp message to meet me there and she asks me how I got in. She's much
more of a rule follower than I and is amused by my malfeasance.

It's around 9:15 so we head for a quick breakfast before beach yoga at 10. We
sit down and Kaiti orders coffee and I tell the waiter I'll do the same. The
breakfast is buffet style & she tells me she doesn't do breakfast so I head up
and fill my plate. When I come back the coffee has arrived but so has a mimosa
and a shot of Bailey's, creamy. I have to say that is an aggressive play at 9:15
AM even for me. I scarf down brekky, the mimosa, and half of my Irish coffee
before we need to head to the beach for yoga.

We spend an hour stretching and posing with the waves crashing against the beach.
It was incredibly relaxing & a great way to start the day... After two drinks
and a big breakfast, of course. After yoga Kaiti's Catholic guilt overwhelms her
and she insists that I buy the guest wristband. I was having a lot of fun living
the life of an outlaw, so this is a pretty lame development. It's already almost
noon so I ask the guy if they have a half day pass, which they don't but he'll
give me a "top shelf" pass for the price of a regular. Sure thanks pal.

From here we go back to the beach to rent stand up paddleboards. I've never SUP'd
before so Kaiti gives me a few pointers when we head out into the water. I'm a
bit wobbly at the start but I eventually get the hang of it. It's a pretty solid
workout and the views are spectacular. After about 15 minutes of tootin around
the bay I decide I'm going to try to make it to the beach across the way before
our hour is up. The wind and current are against me so I work up a pretty good
lather. I don't quite make it to the shore before I need to turn around, by
which point the wind and current have shifted so the easy ride I was expecting
did not happen. It was a workout going back in but I could use the exercise.

After that I worked up a heck of an appetite so we head to the restaurant
reserved for people with the "top shelf" bracelets. We are the only people in
the entire place and Kaiti pounds two guaro sours and a pi&ntilde;a colada with
lunch. She's going to get her money's worth come hell or high water.

We finish lunch and this is about the point that the allure of the all inclusive
resort wears off. I ask Kaiti what there is to do and she says we could do the
pool bar. Or the cabana bar. Or the palapa bar. I look around and realize that
there's no way I could tell if I was in Costa Rica or Orlando. You can't even
see the beach from anywhere on the property, the beach that's considered one of
the country's best. There's a "Costa Rican" theme but it's the type
of theme that's drawn up in a boardroom in a Dallas suburb. Speaking of suburbs,
this dumbass place is even designed like a suburb.

The tiki huts, the faux wood furniture, the Ikea-esque art,
the perfectly manicured grounds, the "lagoon style pool," the wannabe stone
walkways made from stamped concrete... Everything about this place is just so
*phony*. Even their website can't put a spin on it - "our vibrant hotel boasts a
myriad of elevated amenities, including a revitalizing day spa, sparking pools
and an extensive list of world-class dining." If you want a day spa, a sparkling
pool, and world-class dining go to Vegas. Because at least there the dining there
might actually be world class.

If you want to go to Costa Rica *go to Costa Rica*.

I vote that we get off this dumb property and use the one amenity that's actually
worth it, the geographical proximity to Playa Conchal. We head down
to the beach to catch some rays and it's incredibly peaceful. Mostly because all
the nimrods at the resort are bellied up to a kitschy bar dumping back
watered-down cocktails. There are only two other groups on the entire beach,
which I certainly will not complain about.

After about an hour the sun starts getting close to the horizon and surely there
must be a crowd that gathers for the sunset. Surely.

There is not.

Again, I won't complain about having the entire beach to ourselves for the best
sunset I've seen since I've been in Costa Rica. Hell it might be the best sunset
I've ever seen in my life.

Once our noble star has completely disappeared from view miss Kaiti and I walk
back up to the resort. As we're walking down the stamped concrete walkway I see
a constant stream of dead-eyed zombie looking humanoids dressed in Tommy Bahama
walking the other direction.

"Where the hell are they going?" I ask Kaiti

"Dinner"

"Are you serious? It's 6 o'clock? What the hell is the matter with these people?"

They spent the sunset preening themselves for a mediocre dinner at any one of the
remarkably average dining establishments on the property. I'm losing my mind here.

Since all the "world-class" dining establishments require a reservation we opt
for room service where we wash down chalky pizza with flabby wine. 

I throw on my trunks and grab a beer from the mini fridge and head to the hot
tub. I've never had a travail too large a tub couldn't cure. We plop in and the
tub starts to work its magic, loosening muscles, relieving tension, melting
worries. There's another couple on the other side but it's a big tub and they're
paying us no mind. Just as I'm letting go of all the pretentious, citizen-of-the-
world bullshit I spilled on the page above the other couple gets up to leave.

They are walking out of the tub and I toss them a casual "how's it goin'?"
completely out of politeness with no intention to actually hear how it's goin.
Well they take that offhanded remark as an invite to tell us how it's goin, and
boy can I tell you it's fucking boring. We enter into the most dull conversation
with two folks from "the DC area" that makes me want to put my head under water
and not come up. And when I say "we" I mean Kaiti because I would have simply
told them I don't give a shit and she's much nicer than I. All of the
self-righteous indignation I built up this afternoon comes roaring back with a
vengeance.

I think I have a pretty good character sketch of these two so I'll try to paint
the picture. The guy wears his white Oakleys backwards on his head when he's
inside, above an ill fitting blazer and t-shirt with sparkly jeans.

It's a bit funny that my least favorite day in Costa Rica was at a 5-star
all-inclusive resort.
