short_sum: Let's go surfin' now, everybody's learnin' how.
summary: 

I arise in a much cheerier mood than expected given my Busch Light nightcap
and head down to the beach. I'd say it's high time to rip some barrels. I
sample the market and a surf lesson seems to be running
$40-60 depending on your vendor. I start walking down to the fella who quoted me
$40 when a guy who probably can spot a gringo in need of a surf lesson
from a nautical mile away offers me his services.

"&#191;Cu&aacute;nto?"

"Thirty five dollars mi amigo, pura vida," he replies confidently.

Well hot damn, you have yourself a deal. And with whom do I have the
pleasure of doing business?

"Tarzan"

Hell yes. I'm going to learn how to shred the gnar from a guy named Tarzan. I
wouldn't want it any other way. Between the coffee tour with Geronimo and a surf
lesson with Tarzan Costa Rica has blessed me with some pretty kickass names.

Tarzan grabs a board and gives me a crash course on the beach and
I can already tell this ain't gonna be easy. It seems limberness is an attribute
that would benefit a surfer I have the flexibility of a middle
aged woman at Starbucks when they run out of caramel for her macchiato. I try to
nail the technique a half dozen times and each time Tarzan tells me I'm not doing
the thing he just told me to do. I'm laughing my ass off because it's hilarious
how bad I am as this and Tarzan eventually gets tired of repeating himself and
relents.

"Ok let's go surf"

My thoughts exactly, Tarzan.

We walk out into the surf and the waves are rolling in great. Or at least I think
they are. Actually, what the hell am I talking about I've never done this before.
All I do know is the waves are breaking in waist-deep to chest-deep water
so Tarzan can stand there and give me a
push like a dad teaching a kid how to ride a bike. He sees a wave he likes and
gives me a shove. And I fail spectacularly. In an instant. Well dadgum.

Let's give it another go. And another. And another.

I try a few times without even the slightest resemblance to what
anyone would call "surfing." And then just like that Tarzan gives me a shove
and I pop up! I looked like a baby giraffe standing up but I got up! And then
fell. I might have made it 3 seconds but I was up for a bit. A few more wipeouts,
a few more successful attempts of increasing length.

I eventually rack up about 3-4 times where I stay up for an extended period of time
and actually surf. I mean I had no idea how to turn and was wobblier than a frat
boy at 3 AM but I surfed I guess? It was fun when it worked but it was a damn
workout. After a little over an hour of displays of mediocre athleticism I fall
off in pretty shallow water and land a bit funny on my ankle. It didn't really
hurt it was just awkward. I took that as a sign that the ocean had endured
enough of my feeble attempts at recreation and I decide to call it a day. We'll
just keep it at "almost injured" instead of "broken ankle in Costa Rica."

We walk back up to Tarzan's tent where I drop my board and find Kaiti waiting
for me at the bar with a glass of cold, refreshing sangria wine. I thought she
had a shuttle to catch a few hours ago but I guess it was delayed so she
decided to come watch me make a fool of myself. We laugh about it all, mostly
about the golf-ball sized rash on my stomach from rubbing on the surfboard.

Since the first sangria wine was so tasty we decide it would be best to have
another. Whoa-oooooh-ooh-ooooh-oooooooah I love sangria wine!

<h4 class="article-subheader">Well That Escalated Quickly</h4>

We finish our glasses and it's time for her shuttle back to the Westin. We make
the short walk to the pickup point and while waiting for the van a guy starts
talking at us. He asks us where we're from and informs us that he was born
in Costa Rica, grew up in Miami, never got his citizenship, and was
deported about 5 years ago. Kaiti's ride shows up and she is mercifully spared
from our new conversational hijacker.

It's supper time and I try to break away to grab some grub but he dives into his
life story. It's a tale full of drugs, gangs, fights, and jail time. I really
just want to tell him to have a nice day but now I don't want to anger him. I
keep listening and he tells me he had gotten his life in order, had a wife and
two boys, and it all fell apart when he lost a son in a house fire in Miami. It's
pretty heartbreaking and I
think he just wanted someone to talk to. Maybe he wanted to talk to me because I
looked like Jesus. In any case he details the dark paths that he went down that
led him to his current situation, deported from the US, hustling to make it in
Costa Rica. He really doesn't want to be here but it's the hand he's played with
the cards he's been dealt.

His story is seemingly winding down and I'm ready to peel off for some
food and a beer when the entire situation takes a turn. An insane turn that I
wouldn't believe if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes. We were talking in the
main town square, a well lit intersection with dozens of tourists wandering
around, right in front of a popular open-air Argentinian restaurant. A place
that you wouldn't expect what's about to happen.

Out of nowhere like a bat out of hell
a long haired dude charges up and starts attacking him
with a machete taped up with newspaper - presumably with the intention to maim
instead of kill.

That's right, the guy gets attacked with a machete in the
busiest section of the most touristy town in Costa Rica. I look at all the other
gringos on the square and we give each other knowing glances of horror and
confusion. If you could convert the look on our faces to English I believe it
would be something akin to *what the fuck is going on?*

The assailant strikes about half a dozen blows before they tumble out onto the
dimly lit beach. I stand where I'm at for a few minutes completely dumbfounded,
not really knowing what to do. Everyone else gets back to their mulling about
and since I had nothing better to do I joined them in the mulling. I end up
plopping down at El Mercadito, an open-air food hall right next to the
Argentinian restaurant. I'm still trying to process what just happened and after
a few minutes I decide I guess I'll eat something?

I order a steak sandwich named after Leonel Messi and grab a beer from the bar
in the center of the market. I stay for another beer and walk back towards
Sharky's, where a couple Ticas I met said there should be a fun crowd. On
my way over there I see the machete victim walking down the street looking worse
for wear. He's got some pretty serious gashes on his head, neck, arms, and ribs.

I tell him he needs to get stitched up and he says all the clinics are closed &
he doesn't have any money for cab fare to get home. Jesus. I snag the few
bucks I have in my pocket and he says that should be enough. I dip
into the grocery store just before it closes and get him some
rubbing alcohol, Tylenol, and cotton swabs. That's about all they had in terms
of first aid supplies so it's the best I could do.

He thanks me profusely and tells me as I dump him into a cab that I've got a
friend for life. So, uh, I
guess if anybody needs some shady shit done in Costa Rica I have a guy? By now
it's after the 10 PM curfew and everything is closed down. I walk back to my
accommodation and try to get some sleep; it's a little difficult to wind down
after tonight's wild events but I eventually get some shuteye. Costa freakin
Rica.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Kowabunga: Part Deux</h4>

The next day is significantly less eventful than... that. After a run on the
beach and breakfast/coffee I head down to rent a board from Tarzan. I had the
lesson yesterday so let's take the training wheels off and see if I can do this
on my own. Spoiler alert: I can't.

For about an hour I try unsuccessfully to stand up, fighting the waves and trying
to pick the right one without Tarzan there to give me a boost. I almost get up a
couple times,
a kind of half-squat/half take-a-knee position that I can't transition to a
full stand. The waves are a bit bigger today and it's even more of a workout
than yesterday. Plus my board is smaller and much more unstable.
I think Tarzan gives folks the big board while he's giving lessons then
a small wobbly board when they just want a board so they'll go back
to pay more for another lesson. This is just my theory and if it's true I
love the ingenuity. Tarzan is a hustler.

I try and try and try some more then decide to call it a day when my left
shoulder gets a little squirrely on a paddle stroke. This is the shoulder I
dislocated skiing in February and I definitely don't want to deal with that
again. I tip my cap to the ocean and walk off to surf another day.

The afternoon is spent reading and relaxing on the beach. I see the Costa Rican
girls again tonight and meet up with them and two Spanish girls at El Pacifico
after supper for some beers and reggae. The party ends just as it's getting
started due to the curfew and everyone disperses out on the street. As I'm
walking back home I bump into Esteban. We order a few beers from our old friend,
Lady on the Corner, and he tells me about his coffee venture that he's been
working on.

He's a coffee connoisseur and quit his job to try his hand at building
a specialty coffee company. He's been working on building relationships with
suppliers of beans from Tarraz&uacute;, one of Costa Rica's most famous coffee
growing regions.

</figure>

He's in Tamarindo trying to get coffee shops to buy his beans
with limited success. He's a coffee purist and the quality of the coffee he
wants to provide is not yet appreciated by the masses. I think it's similar to
the early stages of the craft beer boom, where people didn't know what they
didn't know about good beer. People are used to their run-of-the-mill commodity
coffee and don't know what they are missing with specialty coffees. It's a tough
racket but his passion is clearly evident. He invites me to try
out his joe, so we make plans to meet up ma&ntilde;ana.

The next morning Esteban picks me up and ferries me to Tamarindo Coffee Roasters
where he's
made friends with the owners and baristas. According to his expert opinion they
make the best coffee in the area, plus they allow him to use their high-quality
Diedrich coffee roaster. He shows me to the back room where he pulls out
a tub of beans and gives them a big ol whiff. It's been 4 days since he
roasted them and he says they have gotten a bit sweeter every day. This is a
medium body, medium acidity, medium roast coffee - right in the meat of the curve.
It should be pretty approachable.

Esteban weighs out some beans then takes them out front to brew.
He readies up a Chemex and tells me the proper technique for preparing it. Once
it's done he pours me a cup and we give it a try. He tells me all the tasting notes:
citrus, dried fruit, and some floral notes, but my unrefined palate only comes
to the conclusion that this is
damn fine coffee. I mention that it's not as hot as most coffee I've had, which
allows me to taste a fuller complement of flavors. He laughs and says that most
coffee is served so hot because it's shit. Good coffee should be served at a
temperature where it's not scalding your mouth and you can actually taste it.
Makes sense to me.

We finish the coffee and as we're about to leave Esteban tells me about
c&aacute;scara, a tea made from the
dried skins of coffee cherries. He had a bag already opened and he reaches in
and scoops out a fistful and pops a few right in his mouth. I follow suit
and they tasted like a mix between dried plums & cherries. It was quite tasty
so I decided to buy a bag as we were leaving.

Esteban drops me off back in Tamarindo where I head to the main square for a
collectivo - an informal taxi that's essentially just a guy with a car that you
negotiate a price for transport. I'm headed up to the Westin - Kaiti said they
have day passes and invited me to spend a day living the life of luxury. Sounds
like a damn good deal to me, let's get fancy.
