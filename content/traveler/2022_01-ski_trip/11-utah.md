<h4 class="article-subheader">Hey Matis!</h4>
"I fell into a bowl uh powdah chowdah!!"

I look over to see Branch chest deep in fluffy Utah powder.

Eric (Lee?) Branch is a born-and-bred Masshole who moved out to Utah a few years
ago and apparently couldn't afford a flight for his accent. He still *pahks*
his *cah* in the lot before shredding the *powdah* at *Pahk City*. I know Branch
through my best good buddy Patrick, who met him while roaming the mean streets
of Boston.

Branch calls me "Matis" because he thinks I look like Mathisyahu (Although
*Stepfather John Misty* is my musical sobriquet of preference). He spells it
"mattis yahoo."

Branch doesn't drink *beers* he enjoys *bowls of loudmouth soup.*

Branch doesn't ______ he _________

Branch is one of the most unique characters I've ever met on god's green earth.

Branch is fantastic.

In a spate of *what a small world-ism* I actually met Branch before Patrick did.
One summer in college I trekked up to Boston for a concert, where I met Branch
through a friend of a friend of a friend. We enjoyed bowl after bowl of
loudmouth soup all weekend long. A few years later
after Patrick graduated college & began his life as a young professional in
Boston he became friends with Branch, completely unbeknownst of our previous
bouts of hooliganry.

Small world indeed.

<h4 class="article-subheader">The Crossroads of the West</h4>
I ring the doorbell and I'm greeted with open arms by Bob & LaGayle & their
roving gang of canine hooligans, Geno, Crosby, ?fifi?, and ?other?. I unload
my gear and they show me to my room. They have a beautiful home and I'm less
than half an hour from 4 incredible ski resorts on my Ikon pass. I feel like I've
died & gone to Utah.

We catch up over the delicious supper LaGayle has prepared, me of the exploits
of the previous ten posts of this adventure, them of their goings on since we
last saw each other two decades ago. One story in particular has stuck with me,
I remember Bob telling a story about a young relative or family friend who was
tagging along with Bob on the slopes. At one point Bob told the young lad to
scoot down aa groomer as he ducked into the trees & they would meet up at the
lift. Well apparently the youngster didn't get the memo and followed Bob into
the trees and got himself in quite a bind.

The thing that stuck with me so strongly as a 12 year old flatlander when
hearing the tale is that someone could possibly ski through the trees. It really
blew my mind. I thought Bob must have been an Olympic caliber skier, which he
wasn't far from - he was on the ski team at Dartmouth and was a monster on a
pair of planks. I say "was" because he was forced into early retirement after a
terrible car accident that he & LaGayle survived way back in Y2K. They are
fortunate and grateful for their health but after the accident Bob's doctors
advised him to hang em up. I can still see a glimmer in his eye every time I talk
about the mountains I've skied or my plans for Utah. It's a combination of
living vicariously and a 

We continue to chat after dinner, LaGayle telling stories of the fun that she
used to have with my mom & grandpa in Tulsa. Those were the days.

Last week while in Big Sky I got a text out of the blue from my best bud Easley's
sister Katie,

"Will you be in Utah next weekend by chance??"

"By god, you bet your ass I will!"

In a wonderful stroke of serendipity Katie will be in Utah for the weekend for her
daughter Blake's volleyball tournament. Apparently Blake's team is a monster and
has a chance to make it to the national tournament based on their results from
this weekend. I just saw Katie & Blake and met Katie's kickass boyfriend Jesse
in August at the beginning of this whole unemployment sabbatical extravaganza.
While it hasn't quite been 20 years I'm still excited to see them.

My plans for my time in Utah are *fluid* so I can meet up with them easy peasy.
Bob & LaGayle warn that the ski areas tomorrow are going to be a zoo since it
will be Saturday and they got some fresh snow. The roads are sure to be
completely logjammed, which leads me to give a quick geography lesson.

<h4 class="article-subheader">The Canyons</h4>
The most iconic ski areas in the Salt Lake City area reside in *The Canyons*,
more properly Big Cottonwood Canyon and Little Cottonwood Canyon. Big Cottonwood
Canyon is home to Brighton & Solitude and Little Cottonwood Canyon boasts Alta
and Snowbird. All four are well regarded but Alta/Snowbird have a special place
in the hearts of many skiers. I say skiers because Alta is one of the few resorts
that still only allows skiers. Snowboarders not welcome.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">The Canyons</figcaption>
</figure>

These canyons receive legendary dumps of snow but, being canyons, don't avail
themselves to the hordes of alpine athletes who swarm the two lane roads every
winter. The demographics point to a steady increase in the number of people
living and recreating in the area, and the anecdotal evidence is stronger than
the avalanches that need to be cleared from the canyons after each big
snowstorm. To add a straw to the back of the camel who has long ago collapsed
and is gasping for air, Covid has exacerbated and accelerated the aforementioned
demographic trends.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">More pink = more snow</figcaption>
</figure>

All of that is to say that I'd be *jazzed* to ski tomorrow but it sounds like
I'd be sitting in traffic and lift lines longer than actually sliding down
a mountain. Katie texts me that they will be day drinking in Park City if I
want to join, which makes my decision easier than a "social studies" class for
an Alabama football player.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Park City</h4>
The next morning I wake up for some coffee & breakfast with Bob, LaGayle, and
the puppers. After brekky I get a quick workout in at their great home gym,
giving my upper body a bit of work after all the pounding my legs have taken on
the slopes. The rest of the morning I just putz around, actually enjoying some
time to relax & recuperate.

Serendipity strikes again when Bob & LaGayle tell me that they are planning a
trip to Park City this afternoon & offer me a ride. Anticipating my condition I
decide the most prudent course of action would be to abstain from driving so I
gladly accept their offer. We load up into Bob's Audi SUV with Pittsburgh
Steelers license plate holders and set off towards PC.

A half hour later they drop me off by the town gondola and tell me the garage
code for the house in case I arrive at an unreasonable hour. I would never.

*Narrator*: he will.

I wander around town for a bit before ducking into ___ for a beer to wait
for Katie & crew to finish up at the volleyball.

While enjoying a Powder Buoy pilsner at Collie's Sports Bar & Grill I get a text
from Branch

*We are gonna be a bit, left my wallet at the house so we've got to turn
around*

Dammit Branch. This is a man who is responsible for the health and wellbeing of
an infant. I can't believe you don't even need a permit to have a kid. Thankfully
his lovely wife Katie does yeoman's work covering for the tomfoolery of her 
husband.

We had discussed meeting up at No Name Saloon, a famous Park City watering hole
where we wasted away an afternoon last year over cold ales between great friends.
We made it back to SLC by the skin of our teeth when an epic snowstorm hit
as afternoon turned to evening.

No Name is a popular spot - at its busiest last year we took a peek out the
window and the line to get in was probably 50 people long - so I decide to go
check it out before everyone else arrives to see how mobbed it is. To my
delight there's no line, plus the bouncer is a Bills fan so we spend 5 minutes
talking ball. I post up at the bar and order myself a Johnny's American IPA from
Moab Brewery to wait for the crew. Before I finish my pint I see Katie, Jesse
and a couple other volleyball parents darken the door of the No Name Saloon.

Bear hugs are shared all around despite the fact that it's only been about 6
months since we last saw each other. We enjoy
a few rounds at No Name then meet Branch at Flanagan's Irish Pub & Restaurant
since No Name disallows children. We enjoy a few more rounds of ales and a
hearty supper before loading up and heading back down I-80 to SLC. I bum a ride
with Branch & family and just like clockwork the snow starts to dump right as
we're leaving town because I can't just ride from Park City to Salt Lake on
clear roads. Branch handles the snow with all the dexterity of a Masshole and
I make it back to Bob & LaGayle's safe & sound. Let's get back to the slopes
tomorrow.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Deer Valley</h4>
Today it's back to Park City to Deer Valley, a posh ski resort that's
famous for its groomers. I skied it last year with some friends and had an
alright time, it wasn't the most challenging skiing but I'll never besmirch
a day on the slopes. The thing that I will besmirch, however, is rich assholes
who don't know how to ski. And this place is crawling with them.

Case in point: last year around
lunchtime we stopped off at a mountaintop bar for some refreshments.
Seeing as it was our last day skiing on the trip we decided to treat ourselves
to some bubbly & splurged on a $150 bottle of Veuve Cliquot to split 5 ways. In
a surprising, but not altogether disappointing, development they were sold out.
*Of a hundred and fifty freaking dollar bottle of champagne*. By noon. That's
the kind of clientele that comes to Deer Valley.

It worked out alright for us because we decided on a bottle for half the price.
And it was so nice we ordered it twice!

</figure>

Now, most of the time I can just ignore the rich assholes. Hell I do it every
day. The thing about rich assholes on the mountain is they ruin the entire
experience for everyone. They slosh snow around like pontoon boats on the 4th of
July, they wipe out getting off the chair, they stop where you're not supposed to
stop, they go where you're not supposed to go. They take videos of their
snot-nosed shithead kids who they think are the next Jean-Claude Killy. They
ruin the *vibe*. But if I skied any other resort on the Ikon I'd have to deal with
the traffic nightmare that is canyon roads after a fresh snow. Like most things
in life it's all about tradeoffs.

</figure>

There are no $150 bottles of champagne in my future, however a bowl of turkey
chili sure is. LaGayle told me as I left the house this morning that I needed
to get the turkey chili while I'm at Deer Valley, it's the best meal she's
ever had on a ski mountain. And Bob has a fondness for Deer Valley due to its
forbiddance of snowboarders. According to Bob, "there's a genetic defect in
snowboarders aged 18-25 that just don't give a shit about anybody else." So for
that fact alone Deer Valley & Alta would be high on his list, as they are two
of the only three ski resorts in the US that do not allow snowboarding, the
other being Mad River Glen in Vermont. As I was growing up Taos was on that list,
however they began allowing snowboarders in 2007, which did not come without its
rumblings.
<a href="https://www.deseret.com/2007/12/27/20061387/skiers-only-two-utah-resorts-among-three-in-the-nation-without-snowboards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One family</a>, who purchased a ski
chalet in Taos
for $1 million and sank another cool $1 million into remodeling, put it up for
sale when the snowboard ban was lifted. They must *really* hate snowboarders.

My first few runs are spent weaving through fluffy mounds of snow scraped down
to the ice by jackasses who would think you're talking about a turkey if you
asked about carving. And then dodging the jackasses themselves - on my third run
while cruising down an easy blue run some imbecile comes from behind me
and skis over the back of my planks, causing me to go ass-over-teakettle. The
landing was soft and I wasn't traveling to swiftly but I yelled at the prick
nonetheless. Rich ski assholes. Can't stand em.

My day improves on the lift ride up when a fella by the name of Jacob offers me
a nip of bourbon. He's not one of the rich assholes. Jacob is a real one. I
spend the early part of the morning taking some runs off the Sultan Express lift,
which has some good runs but they are tracked out pretty bad. I scoot across
the mountain to the Lady Morgan area where I finally find some good snow. It's
slightly far afield and most of the runs over here are more advanced so it keeps
the riff-raff away. Which is fine by me because the Lady Morgan Bowl is
easily the best skiing on the mountain.

I take a few spins over here before
my lunch date with a bowl of turkey chili. After one bite I realize that LaGayle
knows what she's talking about. This is absolutely delicious. I warsh it down
with a Pale Ale from UTOG Brewing Co. out of Ogden, UT.

</figure>

After lunch I cruise around Flagstaff Mountain, the biggest section of the
mountain I haven't been to yet. Some nice, easy runs here before heading back
to the Sultan for a few leg burners and before I know it the day is over. 23,400'
of vert, I'll take that.

Katie texted me to meet up with the crew at Carson Kitchen in downtown SLC so I
pack up my gear and head down that way. 45 minutes later I meet them circled
'round a table with ample libations. I join in the fun and order myself a P1
Pilsner from Salt Flats Brewing in Salt Lake City. But don't drink it. Because
they are fresh out. Ain't no problem, I audible to the Sinday Pale Ale from
Level Crossing Brewing Co, also in SLC.

Blake's team is kicking ass in the volleyball tournament and has a chance to make
it to the finals tomorrow. The catch: the first game is at 8 AM and her
team is notorious for starting slow in the morning. Oof.

I really enjoy the fruity soup&#807;on of passion fruit & guava peeking through
the curtain of mosaic hops we have here in this Sinday Pale Ale so I order
another.

"Oh I'm sorry, we're just ran out of that"

By god are they going to run out of all their damn beer or what? Katie tells me
that a lot of the cities that host these volleyball tourneys ain't ready for the
crowds of teenagers & thirsty parents who descend on their dining establishments.
She estimates around *15 thousand* players & family members are in town for the
tournament. Well I'll be damned. I change my play at the line of scrimmage once
again and order the Upslope Lager. Solid choice.

By this point everyone's worked up an appetite.

"I'll do the pesto chicken flatbread, please"

"Oh so sorry, we're out of the flatbreads.... And the wings... And the turkey
sandwich... And the short rib... And for dessert we're also out of the brownie
and the bread pudding"

My goodness these volleyball players are clearing out their storerooms. I end up
ordering the burger, not great, not terrible. The waiter turns to Branch, who
looks up confidently,

"Ah yeah I'll do the shoht rib"

"I'm sorry sir, we're out of the short rib"

"Branch! Did you not just listen to him rattle off everything they are out of?"

"No, I wasn't listening.. I'm sahhhhhrrryyyy.... Do you have the NY strip?
Yeah? Ok great, I'll do that... medium raaahe"

We continue the revelry for a few more rounds until the food comes out. And
Branch's steak is conspicuously absent. The waiter comes over to ask how
everything is and the Boston man is down a New York strip.

"Oh did they not bring your steak? They said they brought it out... Let me go
check"

As our befuddled server retreats to the kitchen Jesse leans over,

"Watch, they'll be out of it"

No less than a minute later, our waiter returns

"I'm soooooo sorry, but....."

<h4 class="article-subheader">Brighton</h4>
Another day another mountain. Today my playground will be Brighton, one of the
two resorts in Big Cottonwood Canyon along with Solitude. It will be my first
time to Brighton and I'm excited to see what she has to offer.

The weather is overcast with some light flurries as I pull into the lot. I gear
up and head over to the Great Western Express chair. The ridge at the top looks
like it would have some pretty good skiing but the snow just ain't there. I hop
off & cruise down the crest of the ridge, looking for a place that I might have
missed from the lift but it's slim pickins. I end up cruising down Western
Trail to Lone Star for a nice warmup run.

The next couple runs I hit the other edge of the ridge, under the lift on the
Rockin' R and Aspen Glo runs. I work up a bit of a lather and decide to scoot
over to the other side of the hill. I ride up the Snake Creek Express and
Crest Express lifts on my way over to the Milly Express. This section of the
mountain looks like it actually has some decent snow. On my way up I look at
the lines to my left that appear skiable on the trail map but are completely
cliffed out due to the light cover. Damn the luck.

I peel off the lift to my right and bomb down Devil's Dip on the best snow I've
skied on today. I take another run over here before ducking into the Millie
Chalet for a fancy grilled cheese and a Cutthroat Pale Ale from Uinta Brewing in
SLC. After my vittles and suds I gear back up for a couple more runs on Milly
before heading back to the Great Western, where I finish off my day. My last
run I spy a chute off the ridge I missed in the morning and try my hand at
True Grit. Unfortunately the name of the run is all too accurate with a
disconcerting amount of rocks and grit.

I make it down in one piece and it's back to the car and the short drive to Bob
& LaGayle's. I'm planning to meet up with Katie again, tonight is their last
night in town and they want to make the most of it. Giddy up!

I get cleaned up & hail an Uber to meet Katie & Jesse at Varley, a swanky
cocktail lounge in downtown SLC. I order myself a rye old fashioned and find that
the volleyball went just as expected - started slow in the morning to quash their
hopes of nationals. They played valiantly later in the day but their stumble in
the morning cost them. The scheduling gods giveth and the scheduling gods
taketh away. But Katie's not too bent out of shape, the girls gave their all
and she's a proud mama.

Now that volleyball is over she's ready to turn one on like we did at Patrick's
wedding last fall. We have another cocktail at Varley and discuss with the
proprietors the hordes of volleyball locusts that have invaded this weekend. It's
got its pluses and minuses.

After Varley it's next door for more cocktails and merriment at The Ivy.
next door to the ivy
supper at Lake Effect

Midnight is fast approaching so I hail myself an Uber home. Thank god for the
garage code. Now just a quiet 20 minute ride home, maybe I'll even take a quick
nap in the car.

"Hey what's goin' on man, my name's Christoper, you're headed to Holladay?"

"Yes sir"

"Alright, let's go."

*I sink into the backseat*

&emsp;*Lean into the headrest*

&emsp;&emsp;*Succumb to the weight of my heavy eyelids*

"Hey man you look familiar, were you at Alphacon?"

"Excuse me, what?"

"I can spot a fellow alpha when I see one, you must have been at Alphacon."

"I have no idea what you're talking about"

"Alphacon, it's a group of entrepreneurs and alpha dogs who get together to
speak and share their stories with fellow alphas. You'd fit right in"

"Oh I thought I was reading something where they didn't have masks in Oklahoma.
Isn't there an amendment or.. what do you call it.. uh... freedom of healthcare
or something? It says somewhere you can't force people to wear masks, I'm
pretty sure it's in there"

I just give him a look that suggests *you have no idea what the fuck you're
talking about*

"Well I'm probably wrong about the details but I'm pretty sure it's something
like that"

.............

"So like if all these doctors and people on the news knew it was an actual thing
they wouldn't be saying different things in different places? It sounds all made
up the way they talk about it. I don't know I don't trust em"

.............

"So you're between jobs, what kind of job are you looking for?"

"Probably something to do with electrical engineering, EVs, batteries, microgrids,
and the like"

Excitedly, "Did you say EBs!!??"

"No EVs, electric vehicles"

"Oh ok... I thought you said EBs"

*(I'm obviously not an alpha because I have no idea what an EB is)*

"Well if you're ever interested in investing let me know, that's what
I do. A couple alphas like us could crush the market."

"You got it bud. Ok here's my stop, have a nice night"

<h4 class="article-subheader">Mormon Stuff</h4>
Well after that night on the town I wake up with a headache that de-enthuses
my affinity for alpine athletics. Over breakfast Bob gives me a rundown of SLC
and recommends a tour of the Mormon Temple and State Capitol if I plan to
eschew the slopes. Sounds good enough for me.

I load up and drive in a pattern resembling a gradient descent algorithm,
seeing as Bob informed me that all streets North, South, East, and West in Salt
Lake City emanate from the Temple. Only alphas would understand that reference.

I tie up my steed at a hitchin' post near the Temple and walk over to the complex.
The detailed Gothic and Romanesque architecture of the Temple is unfortunately
enshrouded by scaffolding as part of a project to protect the building against
earthquakes. The stone to build the temple was quarried from the aforementioned
Little Cottonwood Canyon, a sturdy quartz monsonite that has the appearance
of granite. The Temple is off limits to
heathens like me so I wander around the grounds & duck into the Tabernacle.

As soon as I enter I'm cheerfully accosted by a sweet Swiss woman who begins
telling me about the tabernacle. Numbers. Facts. Figures.

The building was opened over 150 years ago in 1867.
It stands 250 feet by 150 feet, with no interior support columns to block the view.
Due to a shortage of nails at the time, the roof's trussed timbers were pinned
together with wooden pegs, wrapped in rawhide to hold them in place.k
The pipe organ consists of 11,000 pipes.

Perhaps the most famous aspect of the tabernacle is its remarkable acoustics.
During Gretel's spiel, her husband, Hansel\* strolls to the front of the 'nacle
for a demonstration.

\* They weren't *actually* named Hansel & Gretel... Well actually I can't say
for sure since I didn't catch their names. But there's a nonzero chance they
are named Hansel & Gretel so...

"Von of de most eempressive attributes of ze Tabernacle iz ze acoustics.
Innywhere you seet in ze Tabernacle you can hear perfectly. I vill demonstrate.

I vill tap dis hammer on ze podium

\*click\*

Now I vill tear zis sheet of paper

\*rip\*...\*rip\*...\*rip\*...\*rip\*

And finally, ze acoustics are so perfect zat you can hear a pin drop."

\*tink\*

This might be the first time in my life that I've *literally* heard a pin drop
in a room.

Gretel continues her sales pitch and eventually comes around to the realization
that this fish just ain't gonna bite. She wishes me a good day and I'm on my
way. I continue to wander the grounds of the Latter Day Saints before setting my
course North towards the State Capitol.

Now if you thought Joseph Smith was a con man let me tell you about these
politicians *amirite*!

I stroll around the snowy campus of the Capitol building before ducking inside.
The cavernous hall of the building is empty except another group of tourists
with European sounding accents. The woman working the information desk tells me
I'm free to wander around anywhere I please, which feels like I shouldn't be
able to do that.

In what probably shouldn't come as a surprise, the stone for the Capitol was
quarried in Little Cottonwood Canyon. In contrast to the Mormon Temple, this
stone is a granite, that reminds me of some of the old buildings of my
elementary school.

I stroll around below the rotunda admiring the artwork on the ceiling and
pendentives, displaying significant moments in Utah history. Artworks with titles
such as *Fremont First Sees Great Salt Lake*, *General Connor Inaugurates
Mining*, *Peace with the Indians*, and of course, *Gulls Save the Wheat Fields*.

I continue to aimlessly ramble, past the Senate chamber whose doors are open to
view the halls of the legislative process, where the kids nobody liked in
school display their lack of two neurons to rub together and religious zealots
prove beyond a reasonable doubt they have yet to read the First Amendment to the
Constitution to which they are bound.

I soon grow weary of strolling the vacant hallways, a tedious exercise compared
to watching on TV - with all the new technology they have over at CSPAN, you'd
be better off just sitting in the comfort of your couch to watch the yellow
"average IQ" line hover around room temperature.

After all I have a pit stop to make.

On my way back to the house I stop off at the Wasatch Powder House to inquire
about some rental skis. Now why would I fork over good money to rent skis when
I have a perfectly fine pair under my ownership you ask? Well the canyon has
received a foot and a half of fresh snow the past three days and the forecast
for tomorrow calls for more. I need the right tool for the job.

Powder skis are wider than your everyday ski and they are shaped with a strong
rocker, i.e. they slope up at the front. In contrast, traditional skis are
constructed with what is known as camber, meaning the skis bow up in the middle.
This allows for more precise carved turns and better control on non-powder
surfaces. In the deep stuff, however, the rocker profile and wider base of
powder skis allow them to float on top of fresh snow, giving you
the feeling of skiing on a fluffy cloud of pure alpine bliss.

The pioneer of rockered skis was Shane McConkey, a wildass who I
<a href="/traveler/2021_04-ski_trip/wp/day_2.html?id=mcconkey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote about</a> my first time to Lake Tahoe. He
realized that the wide, rockered design of water skis would work perfectly on
fresh powder. The stuffy ski establishment was sure that this wouldn't work so
to prove them wrong Shane mounted a set of bindings to a pair of water skis and
ripped down a 2,000 foot, 45 degree spine in Alaska.

In 2009, reflecting upon McConkey's life, which was tragically cut short that year in
a skiing/base jumping accident, Jeff Mechura the Global Brand Director at K2 said
that Shane's design was "so far out of the box it was absurd. At first glance,
there was absolutely no logic to it. But it got everyone thinking about skis on
a different wavelength and got our own creative juices flowing again. We started
asking What if? more. Shane was the poster boy for the youth movement
challenging the conventional wisdom of an old-school ski industry.”

Everyone who straps on a pair of planks today owes a debt to Shane McConkey, a
madman, daredevil, visionary, father, who
<a href="https://www.skimag.com/adventure/skiing-will-never-be-the-same-the-life-and-death-of-shane-mcconkey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revolutionized skiing more than anyone before or since.</a>

I arrive at the Powder House and scoot down to the rental shop in the basement.
Travis helps me pick out a pair of planks that will fit my skiing abilities and
forecasted conditions. We land on a pair of Armada Tracer 108s - the width in
the middle of the ski under my foot is 108 mm, compared to the 96 mm of my
Volkls. These should be just the right medicine for my powder flu.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Little Cottonwood Canyon</h4>
The next morning I wake up bright and early for the first of three days of
recreation in Little Cottonwood Canyon. The plan is Alta
today, Snowbird tomorrow, then back to Alta with Branch on Friday. The
forecast calls for snow all day, which consequently calls for the roads to be
a zoo. Considering what a nightmare that will entail, I decide to hitch a ride
on the ski bus. The first stop is just a few miles from Bob & LaGayle's house
so I head out bright and early and catch the first bus. It's a tight squeeze for
the hour-long standing room only ride to the hill. It would have been longer but
the bus was allowed to cut in front of a long line of cars waiting to get into
the canyon so that was nice.

After Sun Valley in Idaho, Alta was the second ski resort in the western United
States to commission a chairlift, with a single seater beginning operation in
1939. The majority of the materials for the chairlift were rummaged from a
decommissioned aerial tramway for transporting silver ore out of the canyon. The
roots of modern human development in this area trace back to mineral extraction
after silver was discovered in the Wasatch range in 1864. The vein was quickly
depleted, however, after a boom and bust in the late 1800s. The area saw another
short boom & bust in the early 20th century but following the Great Depression
the 1930 census recorded six registered voters in Alta, down from the thousands
of prospectors hoping to strike it rich just a few decades before.

When the mining town went bust for the final time, the owner deeded the land to
the US Forest Service in lieu of back taxes. The timing could not have been
better, as the Forest Service was invigorated with New Deal funds. In 1935 a
study was commissioned by Norwegian ski jumper Alf Engen to study the suitability
of the area for a ski resort. Anybody who has skied the fluffy flakes of Alta
would not be surprised to discover that Uncle Alf's report was glowingly
positive. as part of the New Deal, the US Forest Service commissioned a 

I arrive at the Goldminer's Daughter at the base of Alta with a little under an
hour till the first chair. I order myself a coffee and muffin and take the load
off for a while to rest my feet after that bus ride. People start queuing up for
the first chairs of the day and with a half hour to go I gear up and brave the
elements for a spot in line for some fresh pow.

Alta has a mystique in the skiing community. It is one of only three ski resorts
in the US that still don't allow snowboarders - the other two being Deer Valley,
where I skied earlier this week and a place in Vermont. It's consistently ranked
near the top of best ski resorts in the US, with a reputation for challenging
terrain and massive dumps of light, powdery snow. It almost has a cult following
among expert skiers who appreciate the terrain and its no-nonsense approach to
skiing - there are a few basic cafeteria-style dining options and virtually no
nightlife. It's all about the skiing here.

9 AM comes and goes. The avalanche teams are still clearing terrain and
won't open the lifts until they deem the mountain safe. After standing in the
cold, wind, and snow for over an hour they finally start letting patrons board
the ropeway at 9:40. I'm about 20 groups back and by the time it starts loading
the line has distended about 10 times that behind me. The people are ready.

The Collins chair whisks me up the mountain, over run after run of untouched
powdery goodness. At the top I dive into a run called Spruces, a steep chute
with powder up to my waist in places. The vibe on the hill is pure ecstasy, you
can just feel the energy from everyone living their best life. The entire ride
down is like heaven, my skis floating through the fresh snow like a dream. The
only drag is the lift lines, which take 20-30 minutes each time. But I really
can't complain about anything right now.

I take a couple more spins on this lift, ripping down the runs of the West
Rustler ridge. To be fair, I don't really have a choice of lift at this point
since it's the only one that's been opened by avalanche control. Once they open
the Wildcat double I take a ride up and take a soft, fluffy tumble on my way
down when I get lazy and catch a ski in the powder. Even falling on a powder
day is fun.

Lunchtime sneaks up on me and I duck into the Watson Shelter mid-mountain to
warm up my frozen toes
and scarf down a backpack PB&J. It's a quick pit stop and I'm back out there,
this time over the other side of the ridge to the Sugarloaf lift. I find some
great patches of snow off the Cecret Saddle & Devil's Elbow runs before I scoot
over to the Supreme lift. This is where I find the most challenging skiing of
the day in the Supreme Bowl.

Challenging, yes. Fun, also yes. Exhausting, very much yes.

There's a saying in the skiing community, "there are no friends on a powder day," i.e.
everybody is on their own to find the bestest, freshest, fluffiest snow on the
mountain. It worked out great for me since I didn't even have to pretend I had
any friends, just me, my powder skis, and a 2,200 acre alpine playground.

</figure>

This is the kind of day that makes all the shit snow this season worth it. This
is the type of day that will make you shell out hard earned cash for a second
pair of skis. This is the kind of day that will keep you coming back.

When last call rolls around I gather my gear and make for the bus stop. Luckily
the cattle car is much less crowded this go-round and I actually get a seat.
It's only about 30 minutes down compared to the hour-plus logjam on the way up.
I load up my gear into the car and head back to the homestead for some well
deserved supper.

<p class="section-divider my-4">&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;</p>
The next day we're headed right back to Little Cottonwood Canyon, only this time
we're going right next door to Snowbird. This will be my first time skiing it
and I'm very excited.

The roads have been cleared off so I decide to scamper up the canyon atop my own
steed. The road is backed up but the traffic moves at a decent clip. I arrive to
Snowbird at what I thought was bright & early but apparently bright & early has
a different meaning when there's fresh snow on the hill. I have a hell of a time
finding a hitchin' post for the ol' gal but finally find a lot after looping
around the base area a few times.

I unpack my gear and head up to the tram, where I wait about 15 minutes until
it opens then another 15 for the athletes who queued ahead of me to be ferried
to the top of Hidden Peak 11,000' into the crisp Utah air. On the way up I
spotted some lines on the Peruvian Cirque that looked awful tasty.

After soaking in the stunning two-mile-high panoramic vistas I scoot over to the
Cirque Traverse on the ridge above the wide bowl of the cirque. The top of the
bowl is guarded by 10' cliff drop-ins, which I eschew for the more modest entry
of the Middle Cirque. The run is somewhat tracked out but there are still
sections of dynamite snow to be had.

I reach the top of the Little Cloud chair to find hundreds of skiers lined up at
the rope for Mineral Basin. This is the back bowl area that has yet to be
cleared by avalanche control after the big snow dump a few days ago. Translation:
500 acres and 1,300 feet of wide-open untouched powder. I stand up there for
about 5 minutes, hoping to get lucky with the rope drop but decide that I'm here
to ski not stand around like I'm waiting to board a Southwest flight so I head
back down the front side of the mountain, towards the Gad 2 lift.

Another couple runs and I make it back to the Little Cloud lift, whose line has
ballooned with skiers hoping to get some of that fresh pow in Mineral Basin. When
I reach the top of the lift I see the rope has been dropped & scoot over to take
a peek.

Now I've seen some sights on this trip, but the view that unfurls in front of me
as I slide up to the lip of the basin is something to behold. Littering the
wide expanse below me are hundreds of blotches weaving in & out of each other,
dozens of stagnant blotches stomping through waist deep snow looking for skis
they've been dispossessed of. I can only speculate but I doubt many of them are
going to find their equipment. That should pose quite the adventure traversing
to the bottom of the mountain on a single plank.

Someone caught the mayhem at rope drop on their phone. Have a look.

Instead of following the lemmings straight down the bowl of tracked out snow I
follow a handful of athletes sensibly traversing to the right (i.e. the same
line as the people going away from the camera in the video above). We scoot around
an outcropping and in front of me sprawls an enormous bowl of untouched snow
ready for shredding. I spot myself a line and let 'er rip. And boy does she
rip.

Without a doubt this is the best patch of snow I've encountered on my trip.
It feels like skiing on a cloud, my powder skis working as
advertized, floating above the fluff like I'm being pulled by an Evinrude. The
forces of gravity and drag from the knee deep powder perfectly balance in a
beautiful equilibrium, not too fast, not too slow. Each turn is effortless,
linking them together to carve elegant arcs through the pristine duvet of snow.

Unfortunately every blissful dream has to end, and the end of this fantasy
coincides with another end. The end of a gargantuan lift line. I should have
seen this comin'. All them powder seekers and only one way out. The hour-long
wait for the chair is a drag but I'd do it again 10 times out of 10 just to
experience that run again. By the time I reach the top the entirety of Mineral
Basin is tracked out and that hour long wait ain't gonna be worth it this time.

I head back over to the front side and find some decent snow to skier's
left of the Cirque Traverse. I decide to take a quick video of the pillowy
powder and while I'm able to get some turns on tape, I fail miserably at my
original goal of taking a *good* video of the pillowy powder. As you can see the
video is proper shit, shot with my phone in an un-gloved hand and the other hand
holding both poles ski. All while diverting the lion's share of my
attention to wrapping my frigid fingers as tightly as I possibly can around my
phone, lest I drop it in the snow never to see it again.

The lift lines all over the hill and that hour long wait at Mineral Basin has
really decreased my skiing efficiency and the shadows are starting to get long.
I only get in another run or two before last call. All told I only muster 10
runs for a meager 15,584' of vertical. But that's the way it goes on a powder
day.

As I mosey back down the canyon road I remember a conversation with Bob &
LaGayle from a few nights ago. They mentioned that at the mouth of the canyon
lies a great watering hole called the Porcupine Pub & Grille that has wings so
hot they'll burn your face off. If you know me you likely know that I happen to
have a careless disregard for the happiness of my tastebuds so I naturally set
my course for the Porc' and those fiery flappers.

I plop down at a barstool and order a Porcupine Pilsner from Moab Brewery and a
half dozen wings doused in hellfire sauce. The wings arrive about a half pint
into my pils & I prepare for pain. I take the first bite & it's not that bad. I
wait a bit, waiting for a delayed heat. But it never comes. That's all the bite
these babies got. They are hot, sure, but I don't think they are deserving of a
name like *hellfire*. I mention as much to the bartender & she agrees. Apparently
sometime in the past few years they turned down the heat due to the numerous
complaints they received about the wings. For christ's sake if you order wings
that brandish a title such as **hellfire** you should know what you're in for
and accept personal responsibility for your questionable life choices. People
these days are so soft, my word.

I polish off the beer & wings and make the short drive back to Bob & LaGayle's.
They are just as disappointed as I to learn about the wussification of the
Porcupine's hellfire wings. They don't get too reckless with their capsaicin
consumption so they are not personally aggrieved by the development, but there's
something comforting about knowing that the hellfire wings at the Porcupine
are waiting for the next culinary daredevil to tackle.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Take Me Back to Alta</h4>
And now the story returns to our old friend Branch. He planned to pick me up in
the morning but something came up and he'll be delayed. No matter, I just head
to the bus station and ride the cattle car up to the hill. The snow gods haven't
blessed us with fresh precipitation so the bus is much less crowded than the
other day. I gear up and hop on the Collins lift for another day on the slopes
at Alta.

Last night Bob pulled up the trail map of Alta and showed me his favorite runs.
The one run he says I can't miss is called Alf's High Rustler. It stands
menacingly above the loading area for the Collins lift, a test of the best skier's
mettle. Getting there is a bit of a trek, which give credence to Alta's nickname:
Another Long Traverse Ahead. Off the Collins lift you take the high traverse all
the way along the ridge until you think you can't go any more... and keep going.

So I do just that, I ride the ridge towards High Rustler.. and ride.. and ride..
and ride. I eventually reach a point where I'm completely stymied by trees in
all directions. The only direction I can find my way out of this arboreal prison
cell is *up*. I side shuffle uphill about 20 yards, where I find an opening
over the other side of the ridge.

I've actually found myself a nice little honey hole over here, a wide open bowl
without another soul on it. The snow is pretty skied out but there's still some
decent pockets of good snow. As I drop in I get a text from Branch that he just
pulled in and I can meet him at the base of Collins. Seeing as I went up & over
the ridge I'm going to need to swing all the way back around the face of the
mountain towards High Rustler where I was hoping to be in the first place.

I bear left & find a notch where I can get around to the face of the hill. I
quickly realize this was a blunder when I find myself locked in quagmire of
trees. Oh this ol' thing again. I should have just taken my medicine and taken
the rope tow at the base back over to Collins. As it stands all I can do is to
continue traversing across the hill, dodging trees, sidestepping rocks,
avoiding cliffs. It's really not a fun spot to be in.

After grinding it out
through a dense thicket of hazards I finally find a clearing. I stop to catch
my breath, relieved to finally find myself faced with what would actually be
considered a ski run. I know I need to keep traversing to get to Collins but at
this point I'm not passing up any skiable terrain. The run actually turns out
to be a dandy - a steep and narrow leg burner. As I spill out from the bottom of
the run I find myself at the midway point of the rope tow.

All that work and I barely improved my situation. Shame.

I later look at the circuitous route I took on SkiTracks & it appears I hit the
shoulder of the Greeley Bowl to Greeley Hill around the ridge across High
Nowhere (perfectly named if you ask me) and skied down North Rustler by the
grace of god. So while I didn't make it to High Rustler I at least skied
*North* Rustler. So there's that.

I sheepishly grab the rope that pulls me towards Collins at an embarrassingly
slow clip. Fortunately Branch had a bit of a hike from his parking spot and
hasn't been waiting too long. We hop on Collins for the ride right back up from
whence I came. This time we head over the ridge straightaway to Devil's Way
followed by Amen, which is a beautifully poetic sequence of ski runs if you ask
me.

We hop on the Sugarloaf lift, the top of which we peel hard left and keep heading
that way as far as we can because why not? The thing about Alta, and
why I think skiers hold it in such high esteem, is that you *really* have to
know your way around the mountain to experience the best she has to offer. When
we skied it last year it was snowing so hard you could hardly see 10 feet in
front of you and none of us had any idea where the hell we were. We frequently
found ourselves slogging through flat spots, traversing to who knows where, and
cursing its near complete lack of cell reception.

Today is no different. I keep following Branch because I assume he knows what
he's doing, y'know seeing as he lives here and everything, but I eventually find
after an outrageously long traverse that he's just as lost as I. Along the way
we found a group who fell off the traverse track and found themselves stuck in
the waist deep powder, a group in front of us who keep stopping on the traverse,
causing us to nearly crash into the back of their asses, and not a single person
who seems to know where the hell they are. When you are at a local mountain and
don't see a single local you're in the wrong spot. Or at the very least you're
not in the right spot.

As we're wandering the vast unknown parts of Alta I hear a Boston accented
shout from behind me

<br>

**"Hey Matis!"**

<br>

"I fell into a bowl uh powdah chowdah"

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Oh where were we?</figcaption>
</figure>

Or maybe you're in the *exact* spot you're supposed to be.

I keel over laughing like a hyena on the Serengeti. I plop my bum in the snow
and snap an amateur photo of my amateur skiing companion.

After scooping himself out of the chowdah we continue down the fall line and
eventually find ourselves at the bottom of the Supreme chair. This actually
works out great because we have a chance to head to Catherine's.

During my Alta film study with Bob he made sure to mention Catherine's. This
isn't a run but an *area*. Named after Catherine Brighton, a Scottish immigrant
who settled the area where Brighton lies alongside her husband William Stuart
Brighton, Catherine's is a secluded section of the mountain that only the
most dedicated skiers tackle. The reason for this is that you need to hike up
to Catherine's Pass to reach all her alpine glory.

At the top of Supreme we huck our skis over our shoulder and start up the
bootpack to Catherine's. It's really not that bad of a hike per se, the
difficulty lies in the joint inflexibility of ski boots, slippery footing of
snow, awkward toting of skis, and high altitude. During the summer a decently
fit individual could bound up this trail in a matter of minutes. In our
disadvantaged situation it takes us north of 15 minutes to reach the entrance
to Miss Kate's.

I'm here to report that the slog was worth it, however, as the snow back here is
in pristine shape. The hike has kept out all the yahoos and left the runs with
oodles of fresh pow. We neglect to catch our breath after the hike and bomb down
the run as soon as we reach the top of the ridge. Halfway down the first pitch
we succumb to the lactic acid gods and pull off for a breather.

We wind our way down the canyon and stop off at The Hog Wallow Pub, a place
that's accurately described by Google Maps as an "energetic watering hole with
live music". Unfortunately we're a bit early for the music but everything else
is spot on. We get ourselves an order of wings & a pile of nachos. It's really
somethin' that I went the first 57 days of this trip without having wings and
have had them thrice in the past week. I warsh down the vittles with a Uinta
Cutthroat Pale Ale. Branch isn't a man who is content with a single bowl of
loudmouth soup so we have them ladle us another for good measure.

</figure>

As we finish slurping down the suds the aforementioned live music begins setting
up. I think we both realize that if we don't get out of here now we're liable to
shut the place down if they get a band going. We tab out and Branch shuttles me
to the bus station, where he makes sure to use the facilities before the drive
back home.
