summary: 

<h4 class="article-subheader">The Crossroads of the West</h4>
I ring the doorbell and I'm greeted with open arms by Bob & LaGayle & their
roving gang of canine hooligans, Geno, Crosby, ?fifi?, and ?other?. I unload
my gear and they show me to my room. They have a beautiful home and I'm less
than half an hour from 4 incredible ski resorts on my Ikon pass. I feel like I've
died & gone to Utah.

We catch up over the delicious supper LaGayle has prepared, me of the exploits
of the previous ten posts of this adventure, them of their goings on since we
last saw each other two decades ago. One story in particular has stuck with me,
I remember Bob telling a story about a young relative or family friend who was
tagging along with Bob on the slopes. At one point Bob told the young lad to
scoot down aa groomer as he ducked into the trees & they would meet up at the
lift. Well apparently the youngster didn't get the memo and followed Bob into
the trees and got himself in quite a bind.

The thing that stuck with me so strongly as a 12 year old flatlander when
hearing the tale is that someone could possibly ski through the trees. It really
blew my mind. I thought Bob must have been an Olympic caliber skier, which he
wasn't far from - he was on the ski team at Dartmouth and was a monster on a
pair of planks. I say "was" because he was forced into early retirement after a
terrible car accident that he & LaGayle survived way back in Y2K. They are
fortunate and grateful for their health but after the accident Bob's doctors
advised him to hang em up. I can still see a glimmer in his eye every time I talk
about the mountains I've skied or my plans for Utah. It's a combination of
living vicariously and a 

We continue to chat after dinner, LaGayle telling stories of the fun that she
used to have with my mom & grandpa in Tulsa. Those were the days.

Last week while in Big Sky I got a text out of the blue from my best bud Easley's
sister Katie,

"Will you be in Utah next weekend by chance??"

"By god, you bet your ass I will!"

In a wonderful stroke of serendipity Katie will be in Utah for the weekend for her
daughter Blake's volleyball tournament. Apparently Blake's team is a monster and
has a chance to make it to the national tournament based on their results from
this weekend. I just saw Katie & Blake and met Katie's kickass boyfriend Jesse
in August at the beginning of this whole unemployment sabbatical extravaganza.
While it hasn't quite been 20 years I'm still excited to see them.

My plans for my time in Utah are *fluid* so I can meet up with them easy peasy.
Bob & LaGayle warn that the ski areas tomorrow are going to be a zoo since it
will be Saturday and they got some fresh snow. The roads are sure to be
completely logjammed, which leads me to give a quick geography lesson.

<h4 class="article-subheader">The Canyons</h4>
The most iconic ski areas in the Salt Lake City area reside in *The Canyons*,
more properly Big Cottonwood Canyon and Little Cottonwood Canyon. Big Cottonwood
Canyon is home to Brighton & Solitude and Little Cottonwood Canyon boasts Alta
and Snowbird. All four are well regarded but Alta/Snowbird have a special place
in the hearts of many skiers. I say skiers because Alta is one of the few resorts
that still only allows skiers. Snowboarders not welcome.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">The Canyons</figcaption>
</figure>

These canyons receive legendary dumps of snow but, being canyons, don't avail
themselves to the hordes of alpine athletes who swarm the two lane roads every
winter. The demographics point to a steady increase in the number of people
living and recreating in the area, and the anecdotal evidence is stronger than
the avalanches that need to be cleared from the canyons after each big
snowstorm. To add a straw to the back of the camel who has long ago collapsed
and is gasping for air, Covid has exacerbated and accelerated the aforementioned
demographic trends.

All of that is to say that I'd be *jazzed* to ski tomorrow but it sounds like
I'd be sitting in traffic and lift lines longer than actually sliding down
a mountain. Katie texts me that they will be day drinking in Park City if I
want to join, which makes my decision easier than a "social studies" class for
an Alabama football player.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Park City</h4>
The next morning I wake up for some coffee & breakfast with Bob, LaGayle, and
the puppers. After brekky I get a quick workout in at their great home gym,
giving my upper body a bit of work after all the pounding my legs have taken on
the slopes. The rest of the morning I just putz around, actually enjoying some
time to relax & recuperate.

Serendipity strikes again when Bob & LaGayle tell me that they are planning a
trip to Park City this afternoon & offer me a ride. Anticipating my condition I
decide the most prudent course of action would be to abstain from driving so I
gladly accept their offer. We load up into Bob's Audi SUV with Pittsburgh
Steelers license plate holders and set off towards PC.

A half hour later they drop me off by the town gondola and tell me the garage
code for the house in case I arrive at an unreasonable hour. I would never.

*Narrator*: he will.

I wander around town for a bit before ducking into ___ for a beer to wait
for Katie & crew to finish up at the volleyball.

I guess this is the part of the story that I should introduce Branch. Branch is
a friend of Easley's from Boston who moved out to Utah a couple years ago but
couldn't afford a flight for his accent. He still *pahks* his *cah* in the lot
before shredding the *powdah* at *Snowbuhd*.

Branch doesn't drink beers he has *bowls of loudmouth soup*

Branch doesn't ______ he _________.

Branch calls me "Matis" because he thinks I look like Mathisyahu. He spells it
"mattis yahoo"

Branch is fantastic.

In a another example of serendipity I actually met Branch before Easley did,
when I went to Boston for a concert in college. He was a friend of a friend and
we enjoyed a bowl after bowl of loudmouth soup that weekend. A few years later
after Easley graduated college & began his life as a young professional in
Boston he became friends with Branch, completely unbeknownst of our previous
bouts of hooliganry. Serendipity indeed.

While enjoying a Powder Buoy pilsner at Collie's Sports Bar & Grill I get a text
from Branch

*We are gonna be a bit, left my wallet at the house so we've got to turn
around*

Dammit Branch. This is a man who is responsible for the health and wellbeing of
an infant. I can't believe you don't even need a permit to have a kid. Thankfully
his lovely wife Katie does yeoman's work covering for the tomfoolery of her 
husband.

We had discussed meeting up at No Name Saloon, a famous Park City watering hole
where we wasted away an afternoon last year over cold ales between great friends.
We made it back to SLC by the skin of our teeth when an epic snowstorm hit
as afternoon turned to evening.

No Name is a popular spot - at its busiest last year we took a peek out the
window and the line to get in was probably 50 people long - so I decide to go
check it out before everyone else arrives to see how mobbed it is. To my
delight there's no line, plus the bouncer is a Bills fan so we spend 5 minutes
talking ball. I post up at the bar and order myself a Johnny's American IPA from
Moab Brewery to wait for the crew. Before I finish my pint I see Katie, Jesse
and a couple other volleyball parents darken the door of the No Name Saloon.

Bear hugs are shared all around despite the fact that it's only been about 6
months since we last saw each other. We enjoy
a few rounds at No Name then meet Branch at Flanagan's Irish Pub & Restaurant
since No Name disallows children. We enjoy a few more rounds of ales and a
hearty supper before loading up and heading back down I-80 to SLC. I bum a ride
with Branch & family and just like clockwork the snow starts to dump right as
we're leaving town because I can't just ride from Park City to Salt Lake on
clear roads. Branch handles the snow with all the dexterity of a Masshole and
I make it back to Bob & LaGayle's safe & sound. Let's get back to the slopes
tomorrow.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Deer Valley</h4>
Today it's back to Park City to Deer Valley, a posh ski resort that's
famous for its groomers. I skied it last year with some friends and had an
alright time, it wasn't the most challenging skiing but I'll never besmirch
a day on the slopes. The thing that I will besmirch, however, is rich assholes
who don't know how to ski. And this place is crawling with them.

Case in point: last year around
lunchtime we stopped off at a mountaintop bar for some refreshments.
Seeing as it was our last day skiing on the trip we decided to treat ourselves
to some bubbly & splurged on a $150 bottle of Veuve Cliquot to split 5 ways. In
a surprising, but not altogether disappointing, development they were sold out.
*Of a hundred and fifty freaking dollar bottle of champagne*. By noon. That's
the kind of clientele that comes to Deer Valley.

It worked out alright for us because we decided on a bottle for half the price.
And it was so nice we ordered it twice!

</figure>

Now, most of the time I can just ignore the rich assholes. Hell I do it every
day. The thing about rich assholes on the mountain is they ruin the entire
experience for everyone. They slosh snow around like pontoon boats on the 4th of
July, they wipe out getting off the chair, they stop where you're not supposed to
stop, they go where you're not supposed to go. They take videos of their
snot-nosed shithead kids who they think are the next Jean-Claude Killy. They
ruin the *vibe*. But if I skied any other resort on the Ikon I'd have to deal with
the traffic nightmare that is canyon roads after a fresh snow. Like most things
in life it's all about tradeoffs.

</figure>

There are no $150 bottles of champagne in my future, however a bowl of turkey
chili sure is. LaGayle told me as I left the house this morning that I needed
to get the turkey chili while I'm at Deer Valley, it's the best meal she's
ever had on a ski mountain. And Bob has a fondness for Deer Valley due to its
forbiddance of snowboarders. According to Bob, "there's a genetic defect in
snowboarders aged 18-25 that just don't give a shit about anybody else." So for
that fact alone Deer Valley & Alta would be high on his list, as they are two
of the only three ski resorts in the US that do not allow snowboarding, the
other being Mad River Glen in Vermont. As I was growing up Taos was on that list,
however they began allowing snowboarders in 2007, which did not come without its
rumblings.
<a href="https://www.deseret.com/2007/12/27/20061387/skiers-only-two-utah-resorts-among-three-in-the-nation-without-snowboards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One family</a>, who purchased a ski
chalet in Taos
for $1 million and sank another cool $1 million into remodeling, put it up for
sale when the snowboard ban was lifted. They must *really* hate snowboarders.

My first few runs are spent weaving through fluffy mounds of snow scraped down
to the ice by jackasses who would think you're talking about a turkey if you
asked about carving. And then dodging the jackasses themselves - on my third run
while cruising down an easy blue run some imbecile comes from behind me
and skis over the back of my planks, causing me to go ass-over-teakettle. The
landing was soft and I wasn't traveling to swiftly but I yelled at the prick
nonetheless. Rich ski assholes. Can't stand em.

My day improves on the lift ride up when a fella by the name of Jacob offers me
a nip of bourbon. He's not one of the rich assholes. Jacob is a real one. I
spend the early part of the morning taking some runs off the Sultan Express lift,
which has some good runs but they are tracked out pretty bad. I scoot across
the mountain to the Lady Morgan area where I finally find some good snow. It's
slightly far afield and most of the runs over here are more advanced so it keeps
the riff-raff away. Which is fine by me because the Lady Morgan Bowl is
easily the best skiing on the mountain.

I take a few spins over here before
my lunch date with a bowl of turkey chili. After one bite I realize that LaGayle
knows what she's talking about. This is absolutely delicious. I warsh it down
with a Pale Ale from UTOG Brewing Co. out of Ogden, UT.

</figure>

After lunch I cruise around Flagstaff Mountain, the biggest section of the
mountain I haven't been to yet. Some nice, easy runs here before heading back
to the Sultan for a few leg burners and before I know it the day is over. 23,400'
of vert, I'll take that.

Katie texted me to meet up with the crew at Carson Kitchen in downtown SLC so I
pack up my gear and head down that way. 45 minutes later I meet them circled
'round a table with ample libations. I join in the fun and order myself a P1
Pilsner from Salt Flats Brewing in Salt Lake City. But don't drink it. Because
they are fresh out. Ain't no problem, I audible to the Sinday Pale Ale from
Level Crossing Brewing Co, also in SLC.

Blake's team is kicking ass in the volleyball tournament and has a chance to make
it to the finals tomorrow. The catch: the first game is at 8 AM and her
team is notorious for starting slow in the morning. Oof.

I really enjoy the fruity soup&#807;on of passion fruit & guava peeking through
the curtain of mosaic hops we have here in this Sinday Pale Ale so I order
another.

"Oh I'm sorry, we're just ran out of that"

By god are they going to run out of all their damn beer or what? Katie tells me
that a lot of the cities that host these volleyball tourneys ain't ready for the
crowds of teenagers & thirsty parents who descend on their dining establishments.
She estimates around *15 thousand* players & family members are in town for the
tournament. Well I'll be damned. I change my play at the line of scrimmage once
again and order the Upslope Lager. Solid choice.

By this point everyone's worked up an appetite.

"I'll do the pesto chicken flatbread, please"

"Oh so sorry, we're out of the flatbreads.... And the wings... And the turkey
sandwich... And the short rib... And for dessert we're also out of the brownie
and the bread pudding"

My goodness these volleyball players are clearing out their storerooms. I end up
ordering the burger, not great, not terrible. The waiter turns to Branch, who
looks up confidently,

"Ah yeah I'll do the shoht rib"

"I'm sorry sir, we're out of the short rib"

"Branch! Did you not just listen to him rattle off everything they are out of?"

"No, I wasn't listening.. I'm sahhhhhrrryyyy.... Do you have the NY strip?
Yeah? Ok great, I'll do that... medium raaahe"

We continue the revelry for a few more rounds until the food comes out. And
Branch's steak is conspicuously absent. The waiter comes over to ask how
everything is and the Boston man is down a New York strip.

"Oh did they not bring your steak? They said they brought it out... Let me go
check"

As our befuddled server retreats to the kitchen Jesse leans over,

"Watch, they'll be out of it"

No less than a minute later, our waiter returns

"I'm soooooo sorry, but....."

<h4 class="article-subheader">Brighton</h4>
Another day another mountain. Today my playground will be Brighton, one of the
two resorts in Big Cottonwood Canyon along with Solitude. It will be my first
time to Brighton and I'm excited to see what she has to offer.

The weather is overcast with some light flurries as I pull into the lot. I gear
up and head over to the Great Western Express chair. The ridge at the top looks
like it would have some pretty good skiing but the snow just ain't there. I hop
off & cruise down the crest of the ridge, looking for a place that I might have
missed from the lift but it's slim pickins. I end up cruising down Western
Trail to Lone Star for a nice warmup run.

The next couple runs I hit the other edge of the ridge, under the lift on the
Rockin' R and Aspen Glo runs. I work up a bit of a lather and decide to scoot
over to the other side of the hill. I ride up the Snake Creek Express and
Crest Express lifts on my way over to the Milly Express. This section of the
mountain looks like it actually has some decent snow. On my way up I look at
the lines to my left that appear skiable on the trail map but are completely
cliffed out due to the light cover. Damn the luck.

I peel off the lift to my right and bomb down Devil's Dip on the best snow I've
skied on today. I take another run over here before ducking into the Millie
Chalet for a fancy grilled cheese and a Cutthroat Pale Ale from Uinta Brewing in
SLC. After my vittles and suds I gear back up for a couple more runs on Milly
before heading back to the Great Western, where I finish off my day. My last
run I spy a chute off the ridge I missed in the morning and try my hand at
True Grit. Unfortunately the name of the run is all too accurate with a
disconcerting amount of rocks and grit.

I make it down in one piece and it's back to the car and the short drive to Bob
& LaGayle's. I'm planning to meet up with Katie again, tonight is their last
night in town and they want to make the most of it. Giddy up!

I get cleaned up & hail an Uber to meet Katie & Jesse at Varley, a swanky
cocktail lounge in downtown SLC. I order myself a rye old fashioned and find that
the volleyball went just as expected - started slow in the morning to quash their
hopes of nationals. They played valiantly later in the day but their stumble in
the morning cost them. The scheduling gods giveth and the scheduling gods
taketh away. But Katie's not too bent out of shape, the girls gave their all
and she's a proud mama.

Now that volleyball is over she's ready to turn one on like we did at Patrick's
wedding last fall. We have another cocktail at Varley and discuss with the
proprietors the hordes of volleyball locusts that have invaded this weekend. It's
got its pluses and minuses.

After Varley it's next door for more cocktails and merriment at The Ivy.
next door to the ivy
supper at Lake Effect

Midnight is fast approaching so I hail myself an Uber home. Thank god for the
garage code. Now just a quiet 20 minute ride home, maybe I'll even take a quick
nap in the car.

"Hey what's goin' on man, my name's Christoper, you're headed to Holladay?"

"Yes sir"

"Alright, let's go."

*I sink into the backseat*

&emsp;*Lean into the headrest*

&emsp;&emsp;*Succumb to the weight of my heavy eyelids*

"Hey man you look familiar, were you at Alphacon?"

"Excuse me, what?"

"I can spot a fellow alpha when I see one, you must have been at Alphacon."

"I have no idea what you're talking about"

"Alphacon, it's a group of entrepreneurs and alpha dogs who get together to
speak and share their stories with fellow alphas. You'd fit right in"

<div class="mx-3 mb-3"><i>

"Nah man I don't know anything about that"

"Ah ok, well you should look into it, I know you're an alpha, I can spot a fellow

"It's, uh, the Bills"

"Oh cool man, yeah cool, football.. I love football."

"So what state are you from?"

"Oklahoma"

"Ohhh Oklahoma.. Do they have masks in Oklahoma"

"Yeah"

"Oh I thought I was reading something where they didn't have masks in Oklahoma.
Isn't there an amendment or.. what do you call it.. uh... freedom of healthcare
or something? It says somewhere you can't force people to wear masks, I'm
pretty sure it's in there"

I just give him a look that suggests *you have no idea what the fuck you're
talking about*

"Well I'm probably wrong about the details but I'm pretty sure it's something
like that"

.............

"So like if all these doctors and people on the news knew it was an actual thing
they wouldn't be saying different things in different places? It sounds all made
up the way they talk about it. I don't know I don't trust em"

.............

"So you're between jobs, what kind of job are you looking for?"

"Probably something to do with electrical engineering, EVs, batteries, microgrids,
and the like"

Excitedly, "Did you say EBs!!??"

"No EVs, electric vehicles"

"Oh ok... I thought you said EBs"

*(I'm obviously not an alpha because I have no idea what an EB is)*

"Well if you're ever interested in investing let me know, that's what
I do. A couple alphas like us could crush the market."

"You got it bud. Ok here's my stop, have a nice night"

<h4 class="article-subheader">Mormon Stuff</h4>
Well after that night on the town I wake up with a headache that de-enthuses
my affinity for alpine athletics. Over breakfast Bob gives me a rundown of SLC
and recommends a tour of the Mormon Temple and State Capitol if I plan to
eschew the slopes. Sounds good enough for me.

I load up and drive in a pattern resembling a gradient descent algorithm,
seeing as Bob informed me that all streets North, South, East, and West in Salt
Lake City emanate from the Temple. Only alphas would understand that reference.

I tie up my steed at a hitchin' post near the Temple and walk over to the complex.
The detailed Gothic and Romanesque architecture of the Temple is unfortunately
enshrouded by scaffolding as part of a project to protect the building against
earthquakes. The stone to build the temple was quarried from the aforementioned
Little Cottonwood Canyon, a sturdy quartz monsonite that has the appearance
of granite. The Temple is off limits to
heathens like me so I wander around the grounds & duck into the Tabernacle.

</figure>

As soon as I enter I'm cheerfully accosted by a sweet Swiss woman who begins
telling me about the tabernacle. Numbers. Facts. Figures.

The building was opened over 150 years ago in 1867.
It stands 250 feet by 150 feet, with no interior support columns to block the view.
Due to a shortage of nails at the time, the roof's trussed timbers were pinned
together with wooden pegs, wrapped in rawhide to hold them in place.k
The pipe organ consists of 11,000 pipes.

Perhaps the most famous aspect of the tabernacle is its remarkable acoustics.
During Gretel's spiel, her husband, Hansel\* strolls to the front of the 'nacle
for a demonstration.

\* They weren't *actually* named Hansel & Gretel... Well actually I can't say
for sure since I didn't catch their names. But there's a nonzero chance they
are named Hansel & Gretel so...

"Von of de most eempressive attributes of ze Tabernacle iz ze acoustics.
Innywhere you seet in ze Tabernacle you can hear perfectly. I vill demonstrate.

I vill tap dis hammer on ze podium

\*click\*

Now I vill tear zis sheet of paper

\*rip\*...\*rip\*...\*rip\*...\*rip\*

And finally, ze acoustics are so perfect zat you can hear a pin drop."

\*tink\*

This might be the first time in my life that I've *literally* heard a pin drop
in a room.

Gretel continues her sales pitch and eventually comes around to the realization
that this fish just ain't gonna bite. She wishes me a good day and I'm on my
way. I continue to wander the grounds of the Latter Day Saints before setting my
course North towards the State Capitol.

Now if you thought Joseph Smith was a con man let me tell you about these
politicians *amirite*!

I stroll around the snowy campus of the Capitol building before ducking inside.
The cavernous hall of the building is empty except another group of tourists
with European sounding accents. The woman working the information desk tells me
I'm free to wander around anywhere I please, which feels like I shouldn't be
able to do that.

In what probably shouldn't come as a surprise, the stone for the Capitol was
quarried in Little Cottonwood Canyon. In contrast to the Mormon Temple, this
stone is a granite, that reminds me of some of the old buildings of my
elementary school.

I stroll around below the rotunda admiring the artwork on the ceiling and
pendentives, displaying significant moments in Utah history. Artworks with titles
such as *Fremont First Sees Great Salt Lake*, *General Connor Inaugurates
Mining*, *Peace with the Indians*, and of course, *Gulls Save the Wheat Fields*.

I continue to aimlessly ramble, past the Senate chamber whose doors are open to
view the halls of the legislative process, where the kids nobody liked in
school display their lack of two neurons to rub together and religious zealots
prove beyond a reasonable doubt they have yet to read the First Amendment to the
Constitution to which they are bound.

I soon grow weary of strolling the vacant hallways, a tedious exercise compared
to watching on TV - with all the new technology they have over at CSPAN, you'd
be better off just sitting in the comfort of your couch to watch the yellow
"average IQ" line hover around room temperature.

After all I have a pit stop to make.

On my way back to the house I stop off at the Wasatch Powder House to inquire
about some rental skis. Now why would I fork over good money to rent skis when
I have a perfectly fine pair under my ownership you ask? Well the canyon has
received a foot and a half of fresh snow the past three days and the forecast
for tomorrow calls for more. I need the right tool for the job.

Powder skis are wider than your everyday ski and they are shaped with a strong
rocker, i.e. they slope up at the front. In contrast, traditional skis are
constructed with what is known as camber, meaning the skis bow up in the middle.
This allows for more precise carved turns and better control on non-powder
surfaces. In the deep stuff, however, the rocker profile and wider base of
powder skis allow them to float on top of fresh snow, giving you
the feeling of skiing on a fluffy cloud of pure alpine bliss.

The pioneer of rockered skis was Shane McConkey, a wildass who I
<a href="/traveler/2021_04-ski_trip/wp/day_2.html?id=mcconkey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote about</a> my first time to Lake Tahoe. He
realized that the wide, rockered design of water skis would work perfectly on
fresh powder. The stuffy ski establishment was sure that this wouldn't work so
to prove them wrong Shane mounted a set of bindings to a pair of water skis and
ripped down a 2,000 foot, 45 degree spine in Alaska.

In 2009, reflecting upon McConkey's life, which was tragically cut short that year in
a skiing/base jumping accident, Jeff Mechura the Global Brand Director at K2 said
that Shane's design was "so far out of the box it was absurd. At first glance,
there was absolutely no logic to it. But it got everyone thinking about skis on
a different wavelength and got our own creative juices flowing again. We started
asking What if? more. Shane was the poster boy for the youth movement
challenging the conventional wisdom of an old-school ski industry.”

Everyone who straps on a pair of planks today owes a debt to Shane McConkey, a
madman, daredevil, visionary, father, who
<a href="https://www.skimag.com/adventure/skiing-will-never-be-the-same-the-life-and-death-of-shane-mcconkey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revolutionized skiing more than anyone before or since.</a>

I arrive at the Powder House and scoot down to the rental shop in the basement.
Travis helps me pick out a pair of planks that will fit my skiing abilities and
forecasted conditions. We land on a pair of Armada Tracer 108s - the width in
the middle of the ski under my foot is 108 mm, compared to the 96 mm of my
Volkls. These should be just the right medicine for my powder flu.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Little Cottonwood Canyon</h4>
The next morning I wake up bright and early for the first of three days of
recreation in Little Cottonwood Canyon. The plan is Alta
today, Snowbird tomorrow, then back to Alta with Branch on Friday. The
forecast calls for snow all day, which consequently calls for the roads to be
a zoo. Considering what a nightmare that will entail, I decide to hitch a ride
on the ski bus. The first stop is just a few miles from Bob & LaGayle's house
so I head out bright and early and catch the first bus. It's a tight squeeze for
the hour-long standing room only ride to the hill. It would have been longer but
the bus was allowed to cut in front of a long line of cars waiting to get into
the canyon so that was nice.

I arrive at the Goldminer's Daughter at the base of Alta with a little under an
hour till the first chair. I order myself a coffee and muffin and take the load
off for a while to rest my feet after that bus ride. People start queuing up for
the first chairs of the day and with a half hour to go I gear up and brave the
elements for a spot in line for some fresh pow.

9 AM comes and goes. The avalanche teams are still clearing terrain and
won't open the lifts until they deem the mountain safe. After standing in the
cold, wind, and snow for over an hour they finally start letting patrons board
the ropeway at 9:40. I'm about 20 groups back and by the time it starts loading
the line has distended about 10 times that behind me. The people are ready.

The Collins chair whisks me up the mountain, over run after run of untouched
powdery goodness. At the top I dive into a run called Spruces, a steep chute
with powder up to my waist in places. The vibe on the hill is pure ecstasy, you
can just feel the energy from everyone living their best life. The entire ride
down is like heaven, my skis floating through the fresh snow like a dream. The
only drag is the lift lines, which take 20-30 minutes each time. But I'm in no
position to complain.
