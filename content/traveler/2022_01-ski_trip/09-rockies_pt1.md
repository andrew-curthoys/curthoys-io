summary:

<h4 class="article-subheader">20 Degrees</h4>
I roll over in my sleeping bag to check the temperature. This is when I realize
that 20 degrees is about the coldest I'd be willing to tolerate in the spartan
confines of the Uncle Andy Inn. I'll splurge on a hotel if & when the mercury
drops into the teens. I pull the bag up over my head
for extra warmth as I doze off for a couple more hours.

The location of this particular spate of vagabondage is the overflow parking lot
for Schweitzer Mountain Resort, just outside the town of Sandpoint, Idaho. The
resort opened in the fall of 1963, the brainchild of Jack Fowler, a dentist
from Spokane. Dr Fowler, who had a hankerin' for a ski hill closer than the long
journey to Whitefish, MT, first noticed the snow-packed peak during a rest
stop while returning from Whitefish with his family in 1960. Likely
between reprimanding his children for not peeing at the last stop and wistfully
commenting to nobody in particular how they *were* making great time.

The 85 miles to Schweitzer were much more palatable to residents of Spokane than
the 250 to Whitefish. Looking back on the origins of Schweitzer, Dr. Fowler
recalled his modest ambitions for the mountain, "some land, an old Chevy engine
and material for a rope tow. That was our vision Memorial Day weekend 1960." The
ski area opened on December 4, 1963, with one chairlift and a rope tow. So while it
was the brainchild of Dr. Fowler, the growth of the resort was shepherded by
Jim Brown Jr., a lumber magnate who wanted to elevate the resort from a local
ski hill to a national destination.

He and his family poured a fortune into the mountain, replacing the original
lodge with a 3-story Bavarian-inspired lodge, hotels, condos, lights for night
skiing, and a collection of new chairlifts. These substantial investments, while
beneficial for the resort, unfortunately put the Brown family underwater. Facing
significant debt burdens, they were forced to sell the resort 1998 to Harbor
Properties, a Seattle-based ski resort operator. Since then the resort has
continued the work that the Browns started, building new condos, lodges, and
adding chairlifts.

Now the story behind how Schweitzer got its name is truly a delight. It's a
story that belongs in the
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/03-wine.html?id=gg-bridge">Emporer Norton</a>
realm of wackiness. In the late 1800s an eccentric Swiss hermit lived at the base of
the mountain. He, by all accounts, kept to himself, except for one afternoon in
1892. A telegraph operator by the name of Ella Farmin was returning from work
when she was startled by a man in full military regalia, rifle and all, emerging
from the roadside brush. He took the bridle of her horse and walked for a
quarter of a mile before ducking back into the brush.

Mrs. Farmin, justifiably rattled from the encounter, reported the incident to
local authorities. The next day the Kootenai County Sheriff moseyed out to
the man's mountainside dwelling to ask a few questions. When they arrived, they
found the military uniform, but more alarmingly, found the skins of a
number of cats that had disappeared from the neighborhood over the past few
months. Apparently the man had acquired a taste for boiled cat stew, a plot
twist worthy of an episode of *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*. He was hauled
off to an asylum, where his story was lost to history. The mountain, however,
still bears his appellation - "Schweitzer," which is German for Swiss.

Boiled Cat Stew does sound like a good name for a dive bar rock band.

<p class="section-divider my-4">&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;</p>

I arrived to Schweitzer the day before, after my unsuccessful attempt to smuggle
in a kilo of Columbian bam bam\* across the bustling Northern Idaho border. It
was just after 2 PM when I rolled into Sandpoint so I decided I'd do a couple
hours of work at the library. The town of Sandpoint, ID is home to 8,639
residents and one fantastic library. The two story facility is larger, _______
than what I'd expect out of a library in a tiny Idaho town. I click-clacked away
on my computer until closing time at 6, when I decided to head up to the
mountain to check out the little mountain village.

\*bag of oranges

The sun had already set by the time I set out for the hill, a quick 20 minute
drive up some sweeping switchbacks. As I pull into the main lot, past dozens of
condos dotting the mountainside, I see lights up on the mountain and teeny
tiny dots zig-zagging their way down the face of the Schweitzer Bowl. Well by
god it looks like we got ourselves some night skiing!

I have only been night skiing once, maybe twice, when I was a youngster so I
have to give it a try. I quickly throw on my gear that I had stowed away for
tomorrow & set off down the bunny hill next to the parking lot. I hop on a
rickety two-seater chair that dumps me off right by the village square. I hop
on the Basin Express high speed quad next to a nice fella from Texas who is
getting his last turns in before he heads back to the Lone Star State tomorrow.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Tell me what you know about night skiing</figcaption>
</figure>

The farther up the chair we go the colder and windier it gets. By the time we
reach the top I'm full-on shivering. I slide off the chair and make a hard left
for the alighted Midway run. As I start down the run I realize that night skiing
is better in *theory* than in *practice*. In addition to the aforementioned
frigidity, the light is so flat that depth perception proves to be difficult at
best. About halfway down a snowboarder and I nearly avoid a collision, both of
us assuming the other would turn the other direction, like one of those awkward
hallway dances we all do.

I make it to the bottom & decide that one night skiing run is more than enough.
I pop off my planks and head into Taps Bar in the main lodge for
a bite & a beer. I order myself a Cloud Mentality Hazy IPA from 10 Barrel
Brewing in Bend and an order of wings. While I'm enjoying the suds & grub a
live band starts in on a kickass set of original tunes sprinkled between covers
of The Grateful Dead, Bob Seger, Allman Brothers, Rolling Stones, and Tom Petty,
among others.

The music is so good I stick around for another beer, this time opting for the
Apocalypse IPA, also from 10 Barrel. The lead singer of the band, after killing
it on the banjo the first few songs, switches to an accordion... then a
xylophone... then a kazoo... then a melodica... before finally bringing
down the house with a ukelele. I don't think there's an instrument she *can't*
play.

I drop some scratch in their tip jar on my way out, a pittance compared to what
they deserved. Then back partway down the hill to the overflow parking lot
outside the fire station to a spot between camper vans & RVs for a cold night
at the UAI.

<p class="section-divider my-4">&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;</p>

The next morning I crawl out of my sleeping back and stretch my legs in the
snowy parking lot. It looks like we got around 3" of fresh snow overnight, a
good sign for the day's skiing. I set up my camping stove and heat up a can of
soup while wiping the sleep out of my eyes. The soup thaws out my frozen bones
and I pack up camp before heading back up to
the mountain. I was a tad lethargic this morning so I won't be getting the first
turns on the fresh pow but I should still get up there pretty early.

As I wind my way up the mountain road past sign after sign stating "LOT FULL" I
realize I may not still get up there pretty early. Sunday of Presidents Day
weekend after a much needed helping of fresh snow will draw skiers like moths to
a flame. I finally find a spot in the very last row of the very last lot, which,
at this point, is good enough for me.

As I'm unloading my gear I the car next to me says that I'd be better off
waiting for the shuttle, as the line for the little two seater lift I took
yesterday will take over an hour. Sheesh. I grab my skis and trudge over to the
shuttle line, which has grown distended with alpine athletes.

<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/rock1_shuttle.jpeg" alt="Schweitz Shuttle">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">That's the line <b>after</b> that big ol'
	bus filled up & took off</figcaption>
</figure>

While waiting in line the parents in front of me attempt to corral their kids as
best as possible while ambulatorily challenged in ski boots and loaded down with
gear. 3 kids, 2 parents. Outgunned and overworked.

"Hey Jody, don't jump into the snow like that, you'll get snow in your coat,"
dad says to the little boy as he turns his attention to Jody's sister. Like
clockwork a minute later Jody's eyes grow wide as saucers before he breaks into
tears.

Poor Jody got snow in his coat. Hate to say dad told ya so little buddy.

One shuttle comes & goes before we pile onto the next one to whisk us up the
hill to the mountain village. The shuttle driver apparently thinks he's
driving for Ferrari at Monaco, taking each hairpin turn at maximum velocity. All
of us in the back similarly disadvantaged in ski boots smash
into whichever unfortunate soul happens to be on the outside wall of the turn.

Which was an absolute delight to Jody. The little man was shouting
*wheeeeeeeeeeeeeee* the entire ride up. It was pretty adorable.

The bus drops us at the mountain village, where I click into my skis and head
for the Great Escape Quad. As I head up the lift I admire the substantial bowl
of skiable terrain. The runs off to the left don't look like they've been skied
out yet so I reckon I better head that-a-way. I hang a left off the lift down
the Gypsy Ridge and drop into the fresh, fluffy, delicious powder of White
Lightening. There are whole sections of the run that are completely untouched,
leading me to rip a few laps on this particular section of the hill while it's
still fresh.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Not a great photo on account of the falling
	snow but that's all fresh, fresh pow. You're gonna have to trust me</figcaption>
</figure>

After perusing the Schweitzer Bowl I drop into the Outback Bowl on the
backside of the mountain. The first run I hit was *very* skied out, with
enormous moguls that have me sweating by the time I reach the bottom. I ride
back up the Colburn Triple & on my next descent I find a much more enjoyable
route. I roam around the back here for a few runs, exploring all that the
Outback has to offer. My only gripe about this area has to do with the
chairlift layout. In 2019 they replaced the fixed-grip 2-seater Snow Ghost chair
with a two lift setup. The bottom 2/3rds of the bowl are served by the Cedar
Park Express high speed quad, while the top section is accessed by the Colburn
fixed-grip triple. It's a truly asinine layout. 

I think what it boils down to is a classic case of overthinking it. Their
rationale is that the bottom lift will serve beginner/intermediate-level skiers,
while the top lift
will access terrain more desirable for advanced/expert skiers. While this is
true, beginners can still access the more modest runs from the top & I'm sure
that advanced skiers would prefer a longer run to a shorter one. The unloading
point for the Cedar Park Express is maddeningly close to the top of the bowl, if
they had just extended the lift a few hundred feet they wouldn't have even
needed to build the second lift. As it stands, you need to take a slow-speed
triple chair to get out of the bowl, and in ~80% of the bowl you'll need to take
two chairs. I
have really enjoyed my time here, however this is the one aspect of the
mountain that will annoy me to no end.

Anyhoo, on one chair I chat with a couple who tell me that I need to
venture all the way to the bottom of the bowl, below the lifts I've
been riding, to a great bar called the Outback Inn. So my next run I scoot on
down there to get eyes on the bar, which looks like a pretty awesome hang with a
mountain cabin feel. It's another hour or so till lunchtime so I decide to come
back for some sustenance after a couple more runs. As I slide past the bar I
immediately strike that plan from the itinerary. The line for the Stella
high-speed 6-pack - the only chair that serves this area - is gargantuan. It's
easily the longest line I've seen on this trip by a wide margin. I will most
certainly not be coming back here, sorry Outback.

After an interminable wait I finally board Stella. At the top I hang a right to
the Colburn Triple, which takes me to the top of the bowl, where I can drop back
into the front side. I make my way back down to the mountain village for a
little mid-day supper. On my way to the lodge I see a small crowd gathered
'round a snowcat parked in the middle of the town square. Well what do we have
here? I saunter up to the vehicle to find a sign on the side that says "BEER CAT."

10 Barrel Brewing teamed up with pro snowboarder and amateur handyman Mike
Basich to create a beer bar on wheels... Or, rather, tracks. He documented the
process of building out the Beer Cat, have a look.

I scoot up to the Cat and order myself a Nature Calls Mountain IPA. I enjoy the
tasty suds on the brick-lined streets of Schweitzer Village, the first beer I've
ever enjoyed from a snow-based conveyance.

After lunch I make my way up to the Lakeview Triple chair, which access some
great advanced terrain at the top of the Schweitzer Bowl. The line for the chair
is non-existent and the snow is fantastic. I take 5-6 spins over here, my only
complaint being the brevity of the runs. I finish out the day exploring the rest
of the Schweitzer Bowl before calling it a day. A respectable 24,525 vertical
feet.

I unstrap the planks and take a load off with a Schweitzer Apr&egrave;s pilsner
at Taps. Sometimes a beer just hits different after a day of hard skiing. After
savoring the cold cruiser I make my way down to the car for the short drive to
Spokane, WA. My friend and former co-worker Matt and his lovely wife Caitlin
have graciously opened their home to this scraggly rambler living off the road.
After sleeping in my car last night I am certainly not too proud to take them up
on it.

They moved to Spokane in the summer of 2021, when Caitlin matriculated to the
Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine at Washington State. The drive to their place
is a little over an hour & a half, where I roll up
just before suppertime. I am greeted at the door by their adorable dog Barley,
who gets a full complement of scratches and pets. The human residents receive
hugs. It's been a few years since we've seen each other so we have plenty to
catch up on. Matt mostly about groundbreaking developments in protein powder
technology and bicep curl techniques*; Caitlin about her studies and how much of
the Krebs Cycle she can recall.

*We actually had many substantive, erudite conversations. Matt is a great dude.
I'm just contractually obligated to make jokes about his beefcakery. It is in no
way a feeble attempt to deflect feelings of envious inadequacy related to his
ceaseless accumulation of sculpted, lean mass. I would never.

I worked up an appetite on the slopes today so we load up and head to Daft
Badger Brewing for supper just across the Idaho border in Couer d'Alene. I
order myself the pulled pork sandwich and a Mosaic SMASH IPA to warsh it down.
We continue to reminisce over dinner, waxing poetic about the halcyon days of
the San Antonio office. *Those were the days.*

After supper we head back to the house & continue our chat before hitting the
sack. The next morning I wake up & rumble into the kitchen for some coffee.

"Mornin!" Caitlin cheerily greets me as she fixes me a cup o' joe. "Have you
ever heard of Lookout Pass?"

"Sure haven't"

"It's a little local ski area about an hour from here, I just read that they got
a foot of fresh snow last night."

<div style="width:80%; height:0; padding-bottom:65%; position:relative; margin: 0 auto;">

</div>

I'm out the door before they can even say bye. The ski area is 80 miles straight
down I-80 East. The road is a bit slick in patches but nothin' the ol' Nissan
can't handle. I arrive to find the parking lot completely full, with snowplows
clearing spots in the overflow area, which turns out to be part of the Northern
Pacific mountain biking trail. I gear up and make the long trudge up a slight
incline to the lodge. I purchase a modestly priced day pass and slide down to
the Peak 1 Quad.

The first group I ride up with say the Big Dipper run on the North Side has been
skiing great so I head over thataway when I reach the top. I get a little turned
around and bomb down a run by the name of Hercules instead. To be fair with a
foot of fresh snow it really doesn't matter which run you go down, it's going to
be epic.

	</div>
</figure>

The ski area has a local mountain charm, a vivid contrast to the corporate
resorts I've been skiing on my Ikon pass. No glitz. No glamor. Just good, hard
skiing. The lifts don't run as fast as the high speed quads & 6-packs, but that just
leaves more time for chatting with the locals. And it's mostly locals here at
this little hill on the Idaho-Montana border. And when I say on the border I
mean *on the border*. Half of the runs are in Idaho & half are in Montana. I
didn't hear any jawing about which runs are better but I have to imagine it
occurs. At least if people as immature as I live 'round these parts.

All of the runs trundle away from the same peak in different directions, so
there isn't much exploring to do. You just throw yourself off the top until
you reach a lift & ride it back up. It would seem impossible to get lost here
but I'd put it at even odds that my mother would somehow find a way. Whatever
the case, it makes for a very symmetrical elevation trace on SkiTracks.

None of which is to say that the skiing is subpar. I would love to have this as
my local mountain. And this is the best snow I've had the entire trip. I am
happy as a hippo.

I spend the afternoon cruising the wide open bowl on the frontside of the
mountain, occasionally popping into some nice glades with beautiful fluffy
powder. As the day comes to a close I just continue my final run past the lodge
and through the snowy parking lot all the way to my car. Thank goodness the
whole lot slopes downhill, skiing in two different states in a single day can
really take it out of you!

I encounter a minor snafu while loading up my gear when my rooftop cargo box
won't lock properly. It's about 10 degrees outside, turning my poor hands into
icicles while trying to torque the little key. I curse the obstinate cargo box,
reluctant to release the key from its labyrinthine chamber. I capitulate before
catching frostbite and duck into the car for about 10 minutes to warm up my
paws. The second try is a charm, but not without a significant struggle and more
cursing.

I make it back to Matt & Caitlin's before sundown, just as Muscle Milk Matt is
heading to the gym. He invites me to join him as the gymnasium has a hot tub
where I can soak my sore muscles. Y'damn right. We check in at the front
counter, where I pay the $10 vigorish for a day pass. I head to the locker room
to change into my trunks before I am quickly overwhelmed with an overwhelming
tsunami of despair.

SPA TEMPORARILY OUT OF ORDER. SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.

Sunofabitch.

I was really looking forward to stewing in a sweltry pool of stagnant water with
a group of septuagenarians. Well at least my chance of catching MRSA has dropped
precipitously. I wait in the lobby while Matt gets his swole on, never one to
get in the way of a fellow brother in iron's gainzzz. After dinner we head back
to the house for Barley's birthday dinner. We give the birthday girl all the
love & affection she deserves.

The next morning we\* brainstorm the day's Wordle over coffee. One of Caitlin's
classes has organized a Wordle competition and she's near the top of the pack.
After a few minutes of deliberations, we\*\* solve the puzzle on the second try.
An outstanding result that will keep her near the top of the leaderboard. That's
trusting the process.

\*I contributed nothing of value

\*\*Again, I'm using the first-person point of view very liberally here

After the big win Matt agrees to act as tour guide for the cosmopolis of
Spokane. We make the short drive into town and start with lunch at an
outstanding Thai place. We then make our way to the center of downtown for some
aimless ambling. We cruise through Riverside Park, past art installations and
pavilions towards the sounds of crashing water.

We make it to A Place of Truths Plaza, a viewpoint overlooking the lower Spokane
Falls and the graceful arches of the Monroe Street Bridge. Bridge you say?

The Monroe Street Bridge spans 896 feet over the Spokane River, the longest
concrete arch bridge in the US and third longest in the world when it was
completed in 1911. The stately bridge was designed by Spokane City Engineer
John Chester Ralston, supervised by city engineers, and built by local labor
crews, a truly home-grown masterpiece. The bridge also sports pedestrian
walkways on either side, complete with covered pavilions boasting
life-sized bas-relief bison skulls at each pier point of the main arch. I'll
never tire of the elegant shape of an arch bridge.

We walk up to the Washington Water Power building, which was constructed to
harness the hydrostatic energy of the lower falls of the Spokane River. Like a
couple of scofflaws we step over a chain alerting us that the park is closed due
to the snowy conditions. We walk right up to the water's edge for a better view
of the falls. A sharp gust blows off the river that chills me to my bones. I
think I've had enough of the park. The walk back to the car is *frigid*,
straight into the teeth of an unrelenting wind. By the time we make it back my
body is shivering like a wobbly washing machine on spin cycle.

We head back to the homestead for my last night in Spokane. *Last Night in
Spokane* totally sounds like a country song.

Or somethin' like that.

Just gotta find a nice young lady named Luanne

We have supper at the house & play a couple games of Dominion. It's my first
time playing so I certainly don't win but it's a lot of fun. It's easy to set
up, the games are quick, and the permutations are nearly infinite so you can't
just hone in on a certain strategy. This is a game I will definitely be
purchasing. After getting demolished one final time I hit the sack to rest up
for my drive tomorrow.

Cousin Randy is flying into Bozeman tomorrow for a few days of skiing Big Sky
with me. His flight is scheduled for 12 noon and the drive is 6 hours, which
means I'll have to leave at 5 AM to beat him there, accounting for the timezone
change, of course. We'll see about that.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Big Sky Bound</h4>
My alarm squawks bright & early the next morning and I lethargically peel myself
out of bed after a few hearty snoozes. My torpor continues as I languidly load
the car and shove off right at 6:30. Sorry Rand, at least the views from the
BZN airport are amazing.

The directions from Google Maps are pretty straightforward.

1. Get on I-90 E.
2. Follow I-90 for 375 miles to exit 299.
3. Follow Airway Blvd to Gallatin Field Rd.

I think I can figure that out.

About 20 miles east of town I pass by the beautiful vistas of Lake Couer d'Alene,
which was completely obscured by snow the other day when I rolled through here
on the way to Lookout Pass. Which, speak of the devil, I pass right by about
60 more miles down the road.

As I'm winding through the Rattlesnake Mountains of the Lolo National Forest I
glance down at my car's thermometer.

***-17&deg;F***.

Holy smokes.

Speaking of smoke, it's so cold outside that the frigid waters of the St. Regis
River are smoking like a hot tub. It's so cold outside the heat from my body has
created a thin layer of ice on the inside of my window. It's not
just cold, it's *fucking cold*.

About 15 minutes from the airport I get a text from Randy that they just landed.
Looks like I'm not the only one running late today. I pull up to the terminal
to wait for Rand to emerge. And wait. And wait. It's nearly 45 minutes before he
steps out into the brisk Montana air. We'll just blame their laggardly baggage
handling system on supply chain issues. Or wait, is it that nobody wants to work
anymore? One of those excuses seem to assuage nearly all episodes of
disproportionate indignation these days.

I give Randy a big bear hug & load his gear into the car. We set our course for
the Mountainview Lodge a few miles north of downtown Bozeman, one of the few
reasonably priced accommodation options. The most modestly priced room in
downtown Bozeman is over $600/night and if we want to get near the ski hill it
would set us back over a grand. This is my fourth time coming to Big Sky and I
have never seen prices even approach this level of lunacy. Each time before this
we stayed right by the mountain for a reasonable rate. Where we're staying this
time we'll have to drive nearly an hour each way to ski. Dadgum.

We drop our bags and head towards downtown Bozeman, a delightful little
mountain town with stone buildings, ski shops, saloons, and boutique stores
where you can spend a small fortune trying to look like a cowboy caricature from
Yellowstone. Speaking of which, as we near downtown Randy asks how far it is to
Yellowstone. I know the north entrance is just south of here and after consulting
Google Maps it appears to be an hour and a half. Since we have nothing better to
do we decide to bomb down there to check it out.

We head east for 25 miles to the Yellowstone River Valley, just to the east of
the Gallatin Canyon, home of Big Sky. We are treated to stunning views of two
dramatic ridges of mountain peaks flanking a wide valley dotted with farms. As
we're driving we begin to notice the road conditions deteriorating. Before we
know it the entire road is covered in a layer of snow & ice. The sun is starting
to sink low in the sky & we find out that it will set just after we get to the
park. So it will be cold, we won't be able to see much, and the entire drive
back to Bozeman will be in the dark. After a quick discussion we make the
reasonable decision to cut our losses & turn back now.

We probably could have thought of that before setting off on this foolish
endeavor, but sometimes you just gotta give into your impulses. And we got some
great views anyhow.
