summary: Hey Matis! "I fell into a bowl ah powdah chowdah!!" I look over to see Branch chest deep in fluffy Utah powder. Eric (Lee?) Branch is a born-and-bred Masshole who moved out to Utah a few years ago and apparently couldn't afford a flight for his accent. He still *pahks* his *cah* before shredding the *powdah* at *Pahk City*.

"I fell into a bowl ah powdah chowdah!!"

I look over to see Branch chest deep in fluffy Utah powder.

Eric (Lee?) Branch is a born-and-bred Masshole who moved out to Utah a few years
ago and apparently couldn't afford a flight for his accent. He still *pahks*
his *cah* before shredding the *powdah* at *Pahk City*.

Branch calls me "Matis" because he thinks I look like Mathisyahu. He spells it
"Matis Yahoo."

Branch doesn't do things like the rest of us.

Where you or I might enjoy cold beer, Branch will down a *bowl of
loudmouth soup.*

Where you or I might ski some powder, Branch will *dip his oystah crackahs in
tha powdah chowdah.*

Branch hasn't met a soup based reference he didn't like.

Branch is fantastic.

I know Branch through my best good buddy Patrick, who went to college near
Boston. And like two luminous supergiant elliptical galaxies,
it was only a matter of time before the gravitational attraction of these two
behemoth personalities collided.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

<h4 class="article-subheader">The Crossroads of the West</h4>
I ring the doorbell in Holladay, Utah and I'm greeted with open arms by Bob,
LaGayle, & their
roving gang of canine rapscallions, Geno, Crosby, Paco, and ChaCha. They show
me to my room where I unload my gear. They have a beautiful home and I'm less
than half an hour from 4 incredible ski resorts on my pass. I feel like I've
died & gone to Utah.

- them of their goings on since our family took a ski trip out to Utah. That was
spring break 2001 so my visit is *long* overdue.

One story from that 2001 trip has stuck with me - Bob was once skiing with a
young relative or family friend when he decided to duck into the glades for a tree
run. He told the youngster to continue on down the groomer & he'd meet him at
the bottom by the lift. Well apparently the lad didn't get the memo
and followed Bob into the trees where he found himself in quite a bind. He
ended up alright but not without giving Bob quite a scare.

The thing that stuck with me so strongly as a 12 year old flatlander when
I heard the tale is that someone could possibly ski through the trees. It
blew my mind. I thought Bob must be an Olympic caliber skier, which to his
credit, he wasn't far from - he was on the ski team at Dartmouth and a virtuoso
on the slopes.

Unfortunately, he was forced into early retirement after a
terrible car accident that he & LaGayle survived way back in Y2K. They are
fortunate and grateful for their health but after the accident Bob's doctors
advised him to hang up the planks. It's a damn shame because I can see a
glimmer in his eye every time we talk skiing. As I recount the mountains
I've skied, he asks the runs I took & I can see him visualizing every turn.
He is simultaneously grateful for the mountains he has skied and rueful of the
mountains he had yet to ski. It's a moment that forces me to reflect on my good
fortune and feel a deep sense of gratitude for my health and the circumstances
that have allowed me to partake in this incredible adventure. 

We continue to chat after dinner, LaGayle telling stories of the fun that she
used to have with my mom & grandpa in Tulsa. Those were the days.

<p class="section-divider my-4">&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;</p>
On the very first leg of this journey, as I matriculated my way westward,
I had planned to crash one night with Patrick's sister Katie in Phoenix.
Unfortunately that
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/01-go_west.html?id=phoenix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fell through</a>
due to a Covid contretemps. Well in a surprising stroke of serendipity I
received a text out of the blue from Katie last week:

<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/utah_katie_text.jpeg" alt="Katie">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Well I'll be damned</figcaption>
</figure>

Katie's daughter Blake plays on a dominant volleyball team who has a chance to
make the
national tournament if this weekend goes well. My plans for Utah are *fluid* so
meeting up with them should be easy peasy.
Speaking of plans, I've been prodding Bob & LaGayle for a few tips from the
locals for my Beehive State sojourn. They quickly warn me that the roads to
most of the ski areas will be a parking lot tomorrow due to the overwhelming
popularity
of fresh pow Saturdays. Unlike the contributing members of our economy I am not
beholden to weekends for my recreation so I don't *have* to go on a Saturday.
The main reason for the gridlock lies in the unique topology of the
Wasatch Range, which we'll take a look at in today's geography lesson.

<h4 class="article-subheader">The Canyons</h4>
The most iconic ski areas in the Salt Lake City area reside in *The Canyons*,
more specifically *Big Cottonwood Canyon* and *Little Cottonwood Canyon*.
The more
substantial of the Cottonwood Canyons is home to Brighton & Solitude, while the
more diminutive of the two boasts Alta
and Snowbird. All four are well regarded but Alta/Snowbird have a special place
in the hearts of many skiers.

<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/utah_canyons_snowfall.jpg" alt="Snowfall">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">LCC/BCC = Little/Big Cottonwood Canyons.<br>
  More pink = more snow</figcaption>
</figure>

These canyons receive legendary dumps of snow but, being canyons, are not
ideally suited to accommodate the swarms of alpine athletes who flock to the
two-lane canyon roads every winter. The past few decades of demographic trends
show a steady population increase in the area, straining resources and worsening
pollution in the valley.
<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/cities/articles/2020-03-06/a-booming-salt-lake-city-tries-to-manage-its-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This inauspiciously dated article</a>
(March 6, 2020 the last weekend of the *before times*) notes that Utah was the
fastest growing state in the Union from 2010-2018. This growth was accelerated
during Covid, with a 15% increase in net migration rate from June 2020 to June
2021.

So it should come as no surprise that the canyon roads are consistently and
maddeningly logjammed. There is certainly no shortage of
anecdotal evidence - one skier
estimates that his trip to Alta, which used to take 25 minutes, has grown to over
2 hours on a powder day. It's become so much of an issue that plans are in the
works to construct a
<a href="https://www.skimag.com/news/utah-recommends-little-cottonwood-canyon-gondola/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9 mile gondola</a> to alleviate the traffic problem. Even the most
mildly perspicacious among us can deduce that this plan would be *controversial*.
A number of groups have been organized to oppose the gondola
espousing myriad reasons to cancel the project - some legitimate, some
disingenuous NIMBY-ism. It's a sticky situation that won't be resolved
without pissing *somebody* off. If you ask me I think the solution is pack mules.
But that's probably why nobody's asked me.

</figure>

I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to ski tomorrow, but it sounds like
I'd be sitting in traffic and lift lines longer than actually sliding down
a mountain. While mulling it over Katie invites me for some day drinking
in Park City, which makes my decision easier than an "independent study"
class for an Alabama football player.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Park City</h4>
The next morning I wake up for some coffee & breakfast with Bob, LaGayle, and
the puppers. After brekky I get a quick workout in at their convenient home gym,
showing my upper body some love after all the pounding my legs have taken on
the slopes. The rest of the morning I just putz around, actually enjoying some
time to relax & recuperate.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Hey! There's Geno!</figcaption>
</figure>

Just as I'm about to check the price of an Uber to Park City, Bob & LaGayle ask
if I want a ride - they are heading up there anyways so I eagerly accept their
magnanimous offer. We load up into Bob's Audi SUV with Pittsburgh
Steelers license plates and set off towards PC. A half hour later they drop me
off by the town gondola and tell me the garage
code for the house in case I arrive at an unreasonable hour. Unreasonable hour?
I would never.

*Narrator*: he would.

I wander around town for a bit before ducking into Collie's Sports Bar & Grill
for a bowl of loudmouth while I wait for Katie & crew to finish up at the
volleyball. While enjoying my Powder Buoy pilsner I get a text from Branch:

"We are gonna be a bit, left my wallet at the house so we've got to turn
around"

Dammit Branch. This is a man who is responsible for the health and wellbeing of
an infant. I can't believe you don't even need a permit to raise a child. Thankfully
his lovely wife Katie does yeoman's work covering for the tomfoolery of her 
husband.

While Branch fetches his documents, I trundle over to No Name
Saloon, a famous Park City watering hole
right in the heart of town. Last year we wasted away an afternoon at No Name,
drinking beers, eating wings, discussing the artistry of Tom Hanks. While
analyzing the early career exploits of Commander Jim Lovell some light flurries
began to dust the town like something out of a postcard. As afternoon turned to
evening the snowfall intensified and damn
near stranded us in Park City. We made it back to SLC by the skin of our
teeth. Or perhaps more accurately the grip of our Goodyears. We passed dozens of
vehicles on the side of I-80, some by choice, some.. not by choice.

No Name is a popular spot - last year at its busiest we peeked out the
window to see the entry line had distended to 50 people long. To my delight
there's no line when I arrive, plus the bouncer is a Bills fan so we spend 5 minutes
talking about the inhuman things Josh Allen can do with his right arm. I post up
at the bar and order myself a Johnny's American IPA from
Moab Brewery to wait for the crew. Before I finish my pint I see Katie, Jesse
and a couple other volleyball parents darken the door of the No Name.

Bear hugs are shared all around - it's only been 6 months since we've
seen each other but I'll never take for granted an opportunity to kick it with
the Easleys. We enjoy a round of suds while I regale them with a few
tales from the road. Seeing as I've been on the road for almost two months one
round turned to many. So it goes.

Branch eventually makes it to town, this time with his wallet, and we meet him
& his lovely family at Flanagan's Irish Pub & Restaurant since wee baby Remy
ain't allowed at a rough-n-tumble saloon like No Name. We enjoy a few more
rounds of ales
and a hearty supper before loading up for the trek back down I-80 to SLC. I bum a
ride with Branch and just like clockwork the snow starts to dump as
we're leaving town. The weather gods simply won't let me ride from Park City to
Salt Lake on clear roads. Branch handles the snow with all the dexterity of a
Bostonian and we it back safe & sound.

</figure>

That was a lot of fun but I came here to ski. Tomorrow it's back to the slopes.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Deer Valley</h4>
Today I'm headed right back from whence I came, to Park City and the posh slopes
of Deer Valley, a resort famous for its groomers. And rightfully so - every night
a crew of 50 spends 17 hours over two shifts manicuring the mountain's groomed
runs. I skied it last year with Patrick, Branch, and some other Beantown friends
and had a good time - it was the
last day of our trip so we just stuck to the cruisers and our legs thanked us
for it. But the part of the day that I didn't like was the
swarms of rich assholes that polluted the mountain like the Pacific Ocean trash
island. If you don't know how to ski then get the hell out of the way.

A quick story that perfectly encapsulates the milieu of Deer Valley: last year
amid the cruising, we stopped off at a mountaintop bar for some refreshments.
Seeing as it was our last day we decided to *treat ourselves* and splurged on a
$150 bottle of Veuve Clicquot to split 5 ways. In
a surprising, but not altogether disappointing, development they were sold out.
*Of a hundred and fifty freaking dollar bottle of champagne*. By noon! That's
the kind of clientele that comes to Deer Valley. That's the kind of clientele
that ain't never whooped out loud at the sight of a pulling center. Chumps.

<figure class="figure d-table mx-auto">

    <figcaption class="figure-caption" style="display:table-caption;caption-side:bottom;">You do not want to get in his way</figcaption>
</figure>

It worked out alright for us because we audibled to a bottle for half the price.
Which was so nice we ordered it twice!

Now, most of the time I can just ignore rich assholes. But the thing about rich
assholes on a mountain is that you can't avoid them. And they ruin the
experience for everyone. They slosh snow around like pontoon boats on the 4th of
July, they wipe out getting off the chair, they stop where you're not supposed to
stop, they go where you're not supposed to go. They take videos of their
snot-nosed kids who they think are the next Jean-Claude Killy. They
ruin the *vibe*. But Deer Valley is the only resort on my pass that's not in
the canyons so I won't have to deal with
the nightmare that is canyon roads after a fresh snow. Like most things
in life it's all about tradeoffs.

</figure>

There are no $150 bottles of champagne in my future, however a bowl of turkey
chili sure is. LaGayle told me as I left the house this morning that the Deer
Valley turkey chili is a must, it's the best meal she's
ever had on a ski mountain. And Bob has a fondness for Deer Valley due to its
forbiddance of snowboarders. According to Bob, "there's a genetic defect in
snowboarders aged 18-25 that just don't give a shit about anybody else." So for
that reason alone Deer Valley & Alta would be high on his list, as they are two
of the only three ski resorts in the US that prohibit snowboarding. The third
is Mad River Glen in Vermont if you were curious.

When I was a younger lad Taos was also on the no-snowboarding list. That is
until 2007 when the they succumbed to the pot-smokin' board jockeys,
which did not come without its rumblings.
<a href="https://www.deseret.com/2007/12/27/20061387/skiers-only-two-utah-resorts-among-three-in-the-nation-without-snowboards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One family</a>, who purchased a ski
chalet in Taos
for $1 million and sank another cool $1 million into remodeling, put it up for
sale when the snowboard ban was lifted. They must *really* hate snowboarders.

My first few runs at Deer Valley are spent weaving between sloppy piles of snow
sitting atop pistes scraped down
to the ice by jackasses who'd think you're talking about a turkey if you
asked about carving. And then dodging the jackasses themselves - on my third run
while cruising down an easy blue run some imbecile comes from behind me
and skis over the back of my planks, causing me to go ass-over-teakettle. The
landing was soft and I wasn't traveling too swiftly but I yelled at the prick
nonetheless. Rich ski assholes. Can't stand em.

My day improves on the lift ride up when a fella by the name of Jacob offers me
a nip of bourbon. He's not one of the rich assholes. Jacob is a real one. I
spend the early part of the morning taking some runs off the Sultan Express lift,
which has some good runs but they are tracked out pretty bad. I scoot across
the mountain to the Lady Morgan area where I finally find some good snow. It's
slightly far afield and most of the runs over here are more advanced so it keeps
the riff-raff away. Which is fine by me because the Lady Morgan Bowl is
easily the best skiing on the mountain.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Beard blanket</figcaption>
</figure>

I take a few spins over here before
my lunch date with a bowl of turkey chili. After one bite I realize that LaGayle
knows what she's talking about (not that I ever doubted her). I warsh it down
with a Pale Ale from UTOG Brewing Co. out of Ogden, UT.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">day bow bow...turkey chili...day bow bow</figcaption>
</figure>

After lunch I cruise around Flagstaff Mountain, the biggest section of the
resort I've yet to explore. I bank a few nice, easy runs here before heading back
to the Sultan for a couple leg burners and before I know it the day is over. 23,400'
of vert, I'll take that.

Katie texts me to meet up with the gang at Carson Kitchen in downtown SLC so I
pack up my gear and head down that way. 45 minutes later I meet them circled
'round a table with ample libations. I join in the fun and order myself a P1
Pilsner from Salt Flats Brewing right here in town.

But don't drink it.

Because they are fresh out. Never one to let such trivialities interfere with
my apr&egrave;s obligations, I pivot to the Sinday Pale Ale
from Level Crossing Brewing Co, also out of SLC.

Katie gives me the scoop on the volleyball - Blake's team is kicking ass and has a
chance to make the finals tomorrow. The catch: their first game is at 8 AM and her
team is notorious for starting slow in the morning. Yikes.

I polish off my beer, smitten with the fruity soup&#807;on of passion fruit &
guava peeking their way through a curtain of mosaic hops that the fine folks at
Level Crossing have brewed up.

"I'll do another Sinday Pale Ale"

"Oh I'm sorry, we're just ran out of that"

By jove do they have *any* beer left back there? Katie tells me
that many host cities for these volleyball tourneys are not prepared for the
crowds of teenagers & thirsty parents who descend on their polities.
She estimates around *15 thousand* players & family members are in town for the
weekend. Well I'll be damned. I change my play at the line of scrimmage once
again and order the Upslope Lager. Solid choice.

By this point everyone's worked up an appetite. We flag down the waiter who
begins at my end of the table.

"I'll do the pesto chicken flatbread, please"

"Oh so sorry, we're out of the flatbreads.... And the wings... And the turkey
sandwich... And the short rib... And for dessert we're also out of the brownie
and the bread pudding"

Teenage volleyball players are like locusts, they descend on your town in a
terrifying swarm, eating everything in sight. I end up
ordering the burger, not great, not terrible. The waiter turns to Branch, who
looks up confidently,

"Ah yeah I'll do the shoaht rib"

"I'm sorry sir, we're out of the short rib"

"Branch! He **just** said that they were out of the short rib!"

"Well I wasn't listening.. I'm sahhhhhrrryyyy.... Ok, do you have the NY strip?
Yeah? Ok great, I'll do that... medium raaahe"

We continue the revelry for a few more rounds until the food comes out. And
Branch's steak is conspicuously absent. The waiter comes over to do that "so
how is everything?" thing that waiters always do and the Boston man reveals he's
down a New York strip.

"Oh they didn't bring your steak? They said they brought it out... Let me go
check"

Our befuddled server retreats to the kitchen and Jesse leans over,

"Watch, they'll be out of it"

No less than a minute later, our waiter sheepishly returns,

"I'm soooooo sorry, but....."

And we all burst out laughing.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Brighton</h4>
Another day another mountain. Today my playground will be Brighton, one of
two resorts in Big Cottonwood Canyon along with Solitude. It will be my first
time to Brighton and I'm excited to see what she has to offer.

The weather is overcast with some light flurries as I pull into the lot. I gear
up and head over to the Great Western Express chair. The ridge at the top looks
like it would have some pretty good skiing but the snow just ain't there. I hop
off & cruise down the crest of the ridge, looking for a place that I might have
missed from the lift but it's slim pickins. I end up cruising down Western
Trail to Lone Star for a nice warmup run.

The next couple runs I hit the other edge of the ridge, under the lift on the
Rockin' R and Aspen Glo runs. I work up a bit of a lather and decide to scoot
over to the other side of the hill. I ride up the Snake Creek Express and
Crest Express lifts on my way over to the Milly Express. This section of the
mountain looks like it actually has some decent snow. On my way up I look at
the lines to my left that appear skiable on the trail map but are completely
cliffed out due to the light cover. Damn the luck.

I peel off the lift to my right and bomb down Devil's Dip on the best snow I've
skied on today. I take another run over here before ducking into the Millie
Chalet for a fancy grilled cheese and a Cutthroat Pale Ale from Uinta Brewing in
SLC. After the vittles & suds I gear back up for a couple more runs on Milly
before heading back to the Great Western, where I finish off the day. My last
run I spy a chute off the ridge I missed in the morning and try my hand at
True Grit. Unfortunately the name of the run is all too accurate with a
disconcerting amount of rocks and, well, grit.

I make it down in one piece and it's back to the car for the short drive home.
The plan for the evening is to meet up with Katie again - tonight is their last
night in town and they want to make the most of it. Giddy up!

I get cleaned up & hail an Uber to meet Katie & Jesse at Varley, a swanky
cocktail lounge in downtown SLC. I order myself a rye old fashioned and find that
the volleyball went just as expected - they had a lethargic start to the early
morning match, which quashed their
hopes of nationals. They played valiantly later in the day but their stumble in
the morning cost them. But Katie's not too bent out of shape, the girls gave
their all and she's a proud mama.

Now that volleyball is over she's ready to turn one on like we did at Patrick's
wedding. We enjoy another cocktail at Varley and chat with the
proprietors about the mayhem that the volleyball tournament has brought to
downtown dining establishments.

After Varley it's next door for more cocktails and merriment at The Ivy. We hit
up a few more spots on our pub crawl before ducking into Lake Effect for a
late supper. I order myself a hot & spicy chicken sandwich and a Place
Beyond the Pines cocktail. The cocktail is made with High West Double Rye whiskey,
distilled right in Park City and
<a href="https://alpenz.com/product-zirbenz.html" target="_blank" ref="noopener noreferrer">Zirbenz Stone Pine Liqueur</a>,
which is made from the fruit of Arolla Stone Pines. The spiciness of the rye,
coupled with the aromatic richness of the pine liqueur and the
smokiness of a Laphroaig rinse to produce an impossibly complex and delicious
libation. I probably shouldn't order a second but I do anyway because I'm on
holiday.

Midnight is fast approaching so I hail myself an Uber home. Thank god for the
garage code. Now just a quiet 20 minute ride home, hell maybe I'll even take a quick
nap in the car.

"Hey what's goin' on man, my name's Christoper, you're headed to Holladay?"

"Yes sir"

"Alright, let's go."

*I sink into the backseat*

&emsp;*Lean into the headrest*

&emsp;&emsp;*Succumb to the weight of my heavy eyelids*

"Hey man you look familiar, were you at Alphacon?"

"Excuse me, what?"

"I can spot a fellow alpha when I see one, you must have been at Alphacon."

"I have no idea what you're talking about"

"Alphacon, it's a group of entrepreneurs and alpha dogs who get together to
speak and share their stories with fellow alphas. You'd fit right in"

<h4 class="article-subheader">Mormon Stuff</h4>
Well after that night on the town I wake up with a headache that de-enthuses
my affinity for alpine athletics. Over breakfast Bob gives me a rundown of SLC
and recommends a tour of the Mormon Temple and State Capitol if I plan to
eschew the slopes. Sounds good enough for me.

During our discussion Bob informed me that all streets North, South, East, and
West emanate from the Temple, so naturally I drive in a pattern resembling a
gradient descent algorithm right to the front door.
The detailed Gothic and Romanesque architecture of the Temple is unfortunately
enshrouded by scaffolding as part of a project to protect the building against
earthquakes. The stone used to build the temple was quarried from
Little Cottonwood Canyon, a sturdy quartz monsonite that has the appearance
of granite. The innards of the Tempale are off limits to a heathen
such as me so I wander the grounds & pop into the Tabernacle.

As soon as I enter I'm cheerfully accosted by a sweet Swiss woman who begins
telling me about the tabernacle. Numbers. Facts. Figures.

Construction began in 1864 and was completed in 1867.

It stands 250 feet by 150 feet.

The pipe organ consists of 11,000 pipes.

The choir consists of 350 singers.

The seating capacity is 3,500.

And none of those seats has an obstructed view - the entire roof is supported
without a single interior support column. What's more, due to a shortage of
nails at the time of construction, the
roof's trussed timbers were pinned together with wooden pegs that were then
wrapped in rawhide to hold them in place. Pretty remarkable engineering.

But the most famous aspect of the tabernacle is its impeccable acoustics.
During Gretel's spiel, her husband, Hansel\* strolls to the front of the 'nacle
for a demonstration.

\* They aren't *actually* named Hansel & Gretel but let's just pretend they are.

"Von of de most eempressive attributes of ze Tabernacle iz ze acoustics.
Innywhere you seet in ze Tabernacle you can hear perfectly. I vill demonstrate.

I vill tap dis hammer on ze podium

\*click\*

Now I vill tear zis sheet of paper

\*rip\*...\*rip\*...\*rip\*...\*rip\*

And finally, ze acoustics are so perfect zat you can hear a pin drop."

\*tink\*

This might be the first time in my life that I've *literally* heard a pin drop
in a room.

Gretel continues her sales pitch and eventually comes around to the realization
that this fish just ain't gonna bite. She wishes me a good day and I'm on my
way. I continue to wander the grounds of the Latter Day Saints before setting my
course North towards the State Capitol.

Now if you thought Joseph Smith was a con man let me tell you about these
politicians *amirite*!

I stroll around the snowy campus of the Capitol building before ducking inside.
The cavernous hall of the building is empty except another group of tourists
with European sounding accents. The woman working the information desk tells me
I'm free to wander around anywhere I please, which feels like I shouldn't be
able to do that.

In what probably shouldn't come as a surprise, the stone for the Capitol was
quarried in Little Cottonwood Canyon. In contrast to the Mormon Temple, this
stone is a granite that brings to mind some of the old buildings built during
Tulsa's heyday in the early 20th Century.

I stroll around below the rotunda admiring the artwork on the ceiling and
pendentives, displaying significant moments in Utah history. Artworks with titles
such as *Fremont First Sees Great Salt Lake*, *General Connor Inaugurates
Mining*, *Peace with the Indians*, and of course, *Gulls Save the Wheat Fields*.

I continue to aimlessly ramble, past the Senate chamber whose doors are open to
view the halls of the legislative process, where the grown-up versions of kids
that nobody liked in
school display their woeful paucity of neurons and religious zealots
prove beyond a reasonable doubt they have yet to read the First Amendment to the
Constitution to which they are bound.

I soon grow weary of strolling the vacant hallways, a tedious exercise compared
to watching on TV - with all the new technology they have over at CSPAN, you'd
be better off just sitting in the comfort of your couch to watch the yellow
"average IQ" line hover around room temperature.

After all I have a pit stop to make.

On my way back to the house I stop off at the Wasatch Powder House to inquire
about some rental skis. Now why would I fork over good money to rent skis when
I have a perfectly fine pair under my ownership you ask? Well the canyon has
received a foot and a half of fresh snow the past three days and the forecast
for tomorrow calls for more. I need the right tool for the job.

Powder skis are wider than your everyday ski and they are shaped with a strong
rocker, i.e. they slope up at the front. In contrast, traditional skis are
constructed with what is known as camber, meaning the skis bow up in the middle.
This allows for more precise carved turns and better control on non-powder
surfaces. In the deep stuff, however, the rocker profile and wider base of
powder skis allow them to float on top of fresh snow, giving you
the feeling of skiing on a fluffy cloud of pure alpine bliss.

The pioneer of rockered skis was Shane McConkey, a wildass who I
<a href="/traveler/2021_04-ski_trip/wp/day_2.html?id=mcconkey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote about</a> my first time to Lake Tahoe. He
realized that the wide, rockered design of water skis would work perfectly on
fresh powder. The stuffy ski establishment was sure that this wouldn't work so
to prove them wrong Shane mounted a set of bindings to a pair of water skis and
ripped down a 2,000 foot, 45 degree spine in Alaska.

<iframe class="col-12 video-div mb-3" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTLuF-fMG5Q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In 2009, reflecting upon McConkey's life, which was tragically cut short that year in
a skiing/base jumping accident, Jeff Mechura the Global Brand Director at K2 said
that Shane's design was "so far out of the box it was absurd. At first glance,
there was absolutely no logic to it. But it got everyone thinking about skis on
a different wavelength and got our own creative juices flowing again. We started
asking What if? more. Shane was the poster boy for the youth movement
challenging the conventional wisdom of an old-school ski industry.”

Everyone who straps on a pair of skis today owes a debt to Shane McConkey, a
madman, daredevil, visionary, father, who
<a href="https://www.skimag.com/adventure/skiing-will-never-be-the-same-the-life-and-death-of-shane-mcconkey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revolutionized skiing more than anyone before or since.</a>

I arrive at the Powder House about a half hour before close and wander down
to the rental shop in the basement.
Travis helps me pick out a pair of planks that will fit my skiing abilities and
forecasted conditions. We land on a pair of Armada Tracer 108s - the width in
the middle of the ski under my foot is 108 mm, compared to the 96 mm of my
Volkls. These should be just the right medicine for my powder flu.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Little Cottonwood Canyon</h4>
The next morning I wake up bright and early for the first of three days of
recreation in Little Cottonwood Canyon. The plan is Alta
today, Snowbird tomorrow, then back to Alta with Branch on Friday. The
forecast calls for snow all day, which consequently calls for gridlocked roads.
Considering what an ordeal that sounds like, I decide to hitch a ride
on the ski bus. The terminus is just a few miles from Bob & LaGayle's house
so I head out bright and early and catch the first ride up the canyon. It's a
tight squeeze for
the hour-long standing room only ride to the hill. It would have been longer but
the bus was allowed to cut in front of a long line of cars waiting to get into
the canyon, which was nice.

The roots of modern human development in the canyon trace back to mineral extraction
after silver was discovered in the Wasatch range in 1864. The vein was quickly
depleted, however, resulting in a boom & bust cycle all too familiar in the
history of mining. Following the Great Depression, the 1930 census recorded
just six registered voters in Alta, down from the thousands
of prospectors hoping to strike it rich a few decades before.

When the mining town went bust for the final time, the owner deeded the land to
the US Forest Service in lieu of back taxes. The timing could not have been
better, as the Forest Service was awash with New Deal funds. In 1935 the Forest
Service commissioned Norwegian ski jumper Alf Engen to study the suitability
of the land for a ski resort. Anybody who has skied the fluffy flakes of Alta
would not be surprised to discover that Uncle Alf's report was glowingly
positive.

The resort opened for business on January 15, 1939, with a rope tow and the
Collins chair, a single seater that was built with parts rummaged from a
decommissioned aerial
tramway that transported silver ore out of the canyon. This makes Alta the
second oldest chairlift-operated ski area in the Western US, after Idaho's Sun
Valley. The WPA was called upon
to improve the road up the canyon and the CCC built a small outpost, including
the Snowpine Lodge, which was razed in 2017 but replaced with a modern lodge in
the same location. And these weren't the only wintertime recreation projects
spearheaded by the New Deal, which catalyzed the nascent ski industry in the
US - Oregon's
<a href="/traveler/2021_04-ski_trip/wp/day_5.html?id=timberline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timberline Lodge</a> was built by the WPA and
personally dedicated by FDR, and New England is
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/travel/skiing-old-trails-of-the-new-deal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dotted with ski trails</a> that
were cut by the CCC.

I arrive at the Goldminer's Daughter at the base of Alta with a little under an
hour till the first chair. I order myself a coffee and muffin and take the load
off for a while to rest my feet after that bus ride. People start queuing up for
the first chairs of the day and a half hour before the opening bell I gear up and
brave the elements for a spot in line to send it on some fresh pow.

Alta has a mystique in the skiing community. It's consistently ranked
near the top of best ski resorts in the US, with a reputation for challenging
terrain and massive dumps of light, powdery snow. It almost has a cult following
among expert skiers who appreciate the terrain and its no-nonsense approach to
skiing - there are a few basic cafeteria-style dining options and virtually no
nightlife. It's all about the skiing here.

9 AM comes and goes. The avalanche teams are still clearing terrain and
won't open the lifts until they deem the mountain safe. After standing in the
cold, wind, and snow for over an hour they finally start letting patrons board
the ropeway at 9:40. I'm about 20 groups back and by the time it starts loading
the line has grown about 10 times that behind me. The people are ready.

The Collins chair whisks me up the mountain, over run after run of untouched
powdery goodness. At the top I dive into a run called Spruces, a steep chute
with powder up to my waist in places. The vibe on the hill is pure ecstasy, you
can just feel the energy from everyone living their best life. The entire ride
down is like heaven, my skis floating through the fresh snow like a dream. The
only drag is the length of the lift lines, which take 20-30 minutes each time.
But I'm in no place to complain right now.

I take a couple more spins on Collins, ripping down the runs of the West Rustler
ridge. At this point I don't really have a choice of lift since Collins is the
only one that's been opened by avalanche control. Once they open
the Wildcat double I ride it up and take a soft, fluffy tumble on my way
down when I get lazy and catch a ski in the powder. Even falling on a powder
day is fun.

Lunchtime sneaks up on me and I duck into the Watson Shelter mid-mountain to
warm up my frozen toes
and scarf down a backpack PB&J. It's a quick pit stop and I'm back out there,
this time over the other side of the ridge to the Sugarloaf lift. I find some
great patches of snow off the Cecret Saddle & Devil's Elbow runs before I meander
over to the Supreme lift. This is where I find the most challenging skiing of
the day in the Supreme Bowl.

Challenging, yes. Fun, also yes. Exhausting, very much yes.

There's a saying in the skiing community, "there are no friends on a powder day," i.e.
everybody is on their own to find the bestest, freshest, fluffiest snow on the
mountain. It worked out great for me since I didn't even have to pretend I had
any friends, just me, my powder skis, and a 2,200 acre alpine playground.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Hell of a day</figcaption>
</figure>

This is the kind of day that makes all the shit snow this season worth it. This
is the type of day that will make you shell out hard earned cash for a second
pair of skis. This is the kind of day that will keep you coming back.

When last call rolls around I gather my gear and make for the bus stop. Luckily
the cattle car is much less crowded this go-round and I actually get a seat.
It's only about 30 minutes down compared to the hour-plus logjam on the way up.
I load up my gear into the car and head back to the homestead for some well
deserved homemade supper from LaGayle.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Snowbird</h4>
The next day I'm headed right back to Little Cottonwood Canyon, right next door
to Alta at a spot called Snowbird. This will be another first and I'm itching
to tear it up.

The roads have been cleared off so I decide to scamper up the canyon atop my own
steed. The road is backed up but the traffic moves at a decent clip. I arrive to
Snowbird at what I thought was bright & early but apparently bright & early has
a different meaning when there's fresh snow on the hill. I have a hell of a time
finding a hitchin' post for the ol' gal but finally find a lot after looping
around the base area a few times.

I unpack my gear and head up to the tram, where I wait about 15 minutes until
it opens then another 15 for the athletes who queued ahead of me to be ferried
to the top of Hidden Peak 11,000' into the crisp Utah air. On the way up I
spotted some lines on the Peruvian Cirque that looked awful tasty.

After soaking in the stunning two-mile-high panoramic vistas I slide over to the
Cirque Traverse on the ridge above the wide bowl of the cirque. The top of the
bowl is guarded by 10' cliff drop-ins, which I eschew for the more modest entry
of the Middle Cirque. The run is somewhat tracked out but there are still
sections of dynamite snow to be had.

The line for the tram is still extensive when I reach the bottom so I decide to
take a few spins on the Peruvian chair before another couple runs off the
Gadzoom chair. The snow is solid, not incredible but certainly better than a
lot of stops I've made on my trip.

Around midday I unload at the top of the Little Cloud chair to
find hundreds of
skiers lined up shoulder-to-shoulder at the top of Mineral Basin. This is the
back bowl area of the mountain that has yet to be
cleared by avalanche control. Translation:
500 acres of wide-open untouched powder. I stand up there for
about 5 minutes, hoping to get lucky with the rope drop but decide that I'm here
to ski not stand around like I'm waiting to board a Southwest flight.

I venture back down the front side of the mountain where I take a couple runs
before heading back to Little Cloud, whose line has
ballooned with skiers hoping to get some of that fresh pow in Mineral Basin. When
I reach the top of the lift I see the rope has been dropped & mosey over to take
a peek.

Now I've seen some sights on this trip, but the view that unfurls in front of me
as I slide up to the lip of the basin is something to behold. Littering the
wide expanse below me are hundreds of blotches weaving in & out of each other,
dozens of stagnant blotches stomping through waist deep snow looking for skis
they've been dispossessed of. I can only speculate but I doubt many of them are
going to find their equipment. That should pose quite the adventure traversing
to the bottom of the mountain on a single plank.

Someone caught the mayhem at rope drop on their phone. Have a look.

Instead of following the lemmings straight down the bowl of tracked out snow I
follow a handful of shrewd skiers sensibly traversing to the right (i.e. the same
line as the people going away from the camera in the video above). We scoot around
an outcropping and in front of me sprawls an enormous bowl of untouched snow
ready for shredding. I spot myself a line and let 'er rip. And boy does she
rip.

Without a doubt this is the best patch of snow I've encountered on my trip.
It feels like skiing on a cloud, my powder skis working as
advertized, floating above the fluff like I'm being pulled by an Evinrude. The
forces of gravity and drag from the knee deep powder perfectly balance in a
beautiful equilibrium, not too fast, not too slow. Each turn is effortless,
linking them together to carve elegant arcs through the pristine duvet of snow.

Unfortunately every blissful dream has to end, and the end of this fantasy
coincides with another end. The end of a gargantuan lift line. I should have
seen this comin'. All them powder seekers and only one way out. The hour-long
wait for the chair is a drag but I'd do it again 10 times out of 10 just to
experience that run again. By the time I reach the top the entirety of Mineral
Basin is tracked out and that hour long wait ain't gonna be worth it this time.

I head back over to the front side and find some decent snow to skier's
left of the Cirque Traverse. I decide to take a quick video of the pillowy
powder and while I'm able to get some turns on tape, I fail miserably at my
original goal of taking a *good* video of the pillowy powder. As you can see the
video is proper shit, shot with my phone in an un-gloved hand and the other hand
holding both poles. All while diverting the lion's share of my
attention to gripping my frigid fingers around my
phone, lest I drop it in the snow never to see it again.

</div>

The lift lines all over the hill and that hour long wait at Mineral Basin has
really decreased my skiing efficiency and the shadows are starting to get long.
I only get in another run or two before last call. All told I only muster 10
runs for a meager 15,584' of vertical. But that's the way it goes on a powder
day.

As I wind back down the canyon road I remember a conversation with Bob &
LaGayle from a few nights ago. They mentioned that at the mouth of the canyon
lies a great watering hole called the Porcupine Pub & Grille that has wings so
hot they'll burn your face off. If you know me you likely know that I happen to
have a careless disregard for the wellbeing of my tastebuds so I naturally set
my course for the Porc' and those fiery flappers.

I plop down at a barstool and order a Porcupine Pilsner from Moab Brewery and a
half dozen wings doused in hellfire sauce. The wings arrive about a half pint
into my pils & I prepare for pain. I take the first bite & it's not that bad. I
wait a bit, waiting for a delayed heat. But it never comes. That's all the bite
these babies got. They are hot, sure, but I don't think they are deserving of a
name like *hellfire*. I mention as much to the bartender & she agrees. Apparently
sometime in the past few years they turned down the heat due to the numerous
complaints they received. For christ's sake if you order wings
that brandish a title such as **hellfire** you should know what you're in for
and accept personal responsibility for your questionable life choices. People
these days are so soft.

I polish off the beer & wings and make the short drive back to Bob & LaGayle's.
They are just as disappointed as I to learn about the wussification of the
Porcupine's hellfire wings. They don't get too reckless with their capsaicin
consumption so they are not personally aggrieved by the development, but there's
something comforting about knowing that the hellfire wings at the Porcupine
are waiting for the next culinary daredevil to tackle.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Take Me Back to Alta</h4>
The next morning our story returns to our old friend Branch. He planned to pick
me up at Bob & LaGayle's but something came up and he'll be delayed. No matter,
I just head
to the bus station and ride the cattle car up to the hill. We haven't been
blessed with fresh precipitation so the bus is much less crowded than the
other day. I gear up and hop on the Collins lift for another day on the slopes
at Alta.

Last night Bob pulled up the trail map of Alta and showed me his favorite runs.
The one run he says I can't miss is called Alf's High Rustler. It stands
menacingly above the loading area for Collins, a test of the best skier's
mettle. Getting there is a bit of a trek, which give credence to Alta's nickname:
Another Long Traverse Ahead. Off the Collins lift you take the high traverse all
the way along the ridge until you think you can't go any more... and keep going.

So I do just that, I ride the ridge towards High Rustler.. and ride.. and ride..
and ride. I eventually reach a point where I'm completely stymied by trees in
all directions. The only direction I can find my way out of this arboreal prison
cell is *up*. I side shuffle uphill about 20 yards, where I find an opening
over the other side of the ridge.

I've actually found myself a nice little honey hole over here, a wide open bowl
without another soul on it. The snow is pretty skied out but there's still some
decent pockets of good powder. As I drop in I get a text from Branch that he just
pulled in and I can meet him at the base of Collins. Seeing as I went up & over
the ridge if I want to make it to Collins I'm going to need to swing all the way
back around the face of the
mountain towards High Rustler where I was hoping to be in the first place.

I bear left & find a notch where I can get around to the face of the hill. I
quickly realize I've blundered when I find myself locked in quagmire of
trees. Oh this ol' thing again. I should have just taken my medicine and
accepted the fact that I'll need to take the rope tow back to Collins. As it
stands all I can do is to continue traversing across the hill, dodging trees,
sidestepping rocks, avoiding cliffs. It's really not a fun spot to be in.

After grinding it out
through a dense thicket of hazards I finally find a clearing. I stop to catch
my breath, relieved to finally find myself faced with what would actually be
considered a ski run. I know I need to keep traversing to get to Collins but at
this point I'm not passing up any skiable terrain. The run actually turns out
to be a dandy - a steep and narrow leg burner. As I spill out from the bottom of
the run I find myself at the midway point of the rope tow.

<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/utah_alta_alfs.png" alt="Alfs">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">The blunder occurred on the other side of
  the hill, this is just the result</figcaption>
</figure>

All that work and I barely improved my situation. Shame.

I later look at the circuitous route I took on SkiTracks & it appears I hit the
shoulder of the Greeley Bowl to Greeley Hill around the ridge across High
Nowhere (the start of the "where I went" line above) and skied down North
Rustler by the grace of god. So while I didn't make it to High Rustler I at
least skied *North* Rustler. So there's that.

I sheepishly grab the rope that pulls me towards Collins at an embarrassingly
slow clip. Fortunately Branch had a bit of a hike from his parking spot and
hasn't been waiting too long. We hop on Collins for the ride right back up from
whence I came. This time we head over the ridge straightaway to Devil's Way
followed by Amen, which is a beautifully poetic sequence of ski runs if you ask
me.

We hop on the Sugarloaf lift, the top of which we peel hard left and keep heading
that way as far as we can because why not? The thing about Alta, and
why I think skiers hold it in such high esteem, is that you *really* have to
know your way around the mountain to experience the best she has to offer. When
we skied it last year it was snowing so hard you could hardly see 10 feet in
front of you and none of us had any idea where the hell we were. We frequently
found ourselves slogging through flat spots, traversing to who knows where, and
cursing its near complete lack of cell reception.

Today is no different. I keep following Branch because I assume he knows what
he's doing, y'know seeing as he lives here and everything, but I eventually find
after an outrageously long traverse that he's just as lost as I. Along the way
we found a group who fell off the track and found themselves stuck in
waist deep powder, another group in front of us who keep stopping on the traverse,
causing us to nearly crash into the back of their asses, and not a single person
who seems to know where the hell they are. When you are at a local mountain and
don't see a single local you're in the wrong spot. Or at the very least you're
not in the right spot.

As we're wandering the vast unknown parts of Alta I hear a Boston accented
shout from behind me

<br>

**"Hey Matis!"**

<br>

"I fell into a bowl uh powdah chowdah"

<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/utah_branch_powder.jpeg" alt="Branch">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Oh where were we?</figcaption>
</figure>

Or maybe you're in the *exact* spot you're supposed to be.

I keel over laughing like a hyena on the Serengeti. I plop my bum in the snow
and snap an amateur photo of my amateur skiing companion.

After scooping himself out of the chowdah we continue down the fall line and
eventually find ourselves at the bottom of the Supreme chair. This actually
works out great because we have a chance to head to Catherine's.

During my Alta film study with Bob he made sure to mention Catherine's. This
isn't a run but an *area*. Named after Catherine Brighton, a Scottish immigrant
who settled these parts alongside her husband William Stuart Brighton,
Catherine's is a secluded section of the mountain that's available only to the
most dedicated skiers. Mostly because a solid hike is required to reach all
her alpine glory.

We unload at Supreme & huck our skis over our shoulder headed for the
bootpack to Catherine's. It's really not that bad of a hike per se - the
difficulty lies in the inflexibility of ski boots, slippery footing of
snow, awkward toting of skis, and high altitude. During the summer a decently
fit individual could bound up this trail in a matter of minutes. In our
disadvantaged situation it takes us north of 15 minutes to reach the entrance
to Miss Kate's.

I'm here to report that the slog was worth it, as the snow over yonder is
in pristine shape. The hike has kept out all the yahoos and left the runs with
oodles of fresh pow. We're too excited to catch our breath after the hike and
bomb down the ridge as soon as we reach the precipice. Halfway down the first pitch
we succumb to our spiking lactic acid levels and pull off for a breather.

We catch our breath & keep charging down the piste, all the way to the base
area where we duck into Goldminer's Daughter for some sustenance. I
order up a buffalo chicken wrap and pair it with a Dallas Alice Blonde from
Level Crossing, mostly due to the Little Feat reference. After lunch we
head back out there for a few more rides
up Collins and a spin or two on Sugarloaf. Before we know it the day is done
and we head back to Branch's car.

After trundling down the canyon we stop off at The Hog Wallow Pub, a place
described by Google Maps as an "energetic watering hole with
live music". Unfortunately we're a bit early for the music but everything else
is spot on. We decide on an order of wings and pair it with a pile of nachos,
a beautiful apr&egrave;s ski combination. It's really
somethin' that I went the first 57 days of this trip without having wings and
have had them thrice in the past week. I warsh down the vittles with a Uinta
Cutthroat Pale Ale. Branch isn't a man who is content with a single bowl of
loudmouth soup so we have them ladle us another for good measure.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Down at the Waller</figcaption>
</figure>

As we finish slurping down the suds the aforementioned live music begins setting
up. We shoot each other a knowing looks that we should skedaddle now or we're
liable to shut the place down if a band gets going. We tab out and Branch
shuttles me to the bus station, where he makes sure to use the facilities before
the drive back home.

It feels like I only got here yesterday but somehow it's time again to hit the
ol' dusty trail. I'm Colorado bound in the morning, back for another hit of that
Rocky Mountain High.
