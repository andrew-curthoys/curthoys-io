summary: As Randy jets off back to Vegas I hit the road due East on I-90, bound for Powell, a cozy Wyoming town just outside Cody. Awaiting me is another former coworker and current friend named Dusty, who has foolishly invited me to stay with him and his lovely family. The drive is a pleasant 3 hour cruise through light snow flurries skirting the Northeastern rim of the Yellowstone Plateau.

As Randy jets off back to Vegas I hit the road due East on I-90, bound for
Powell, a cozy Wyoming town just outside Cody. Awaiting me is another former
coworker and current friend named Dusty, who has foolishly invited me to stay with
him and his lovely family. The drive is a pleasant 3 hour cruise through light
snow flurries skirting the Northeastern rim of the Yellowstone Plateau.

When I arrive Dusty introduces me to his wonderful wife Shelly and impressive 
youngsters.
The oldest, Zach, is a senior in high school committed to the University of
Wyoming; in the middle is Kenzie, a sophomore in high school; and last but not
least is Addy, who is machete-ing her way through the jungles of 6th grade. I *do
not* miss those days.
I would be remiss to forget Sage River the Goldendoodle, and my best bud
Charlie, a cantankerous Basset Hound after my own heart.

Before I even finish unloading the rig Dusty offers me a cold beer. Y'damn right!
As I enjoy a Cold Smoke Scotch Ale from KettleHouse Brewing in Missoula
we catch up about the past few years. He's a born-and-bred Wyoming man, so
his return to the Cowboy State was a much deserved breath of
fresh air. Being a Wyoming man, of course, makes him a fan of
Big Josh (despite the sad fact that he supports the Patriots. Yuck). His weekends
are often spent at basketball, football, or volleyball games so I spam his phone
anytime Josh uncoils a pigskin missile from his laser rocket arm (a very frequent
occurrence). He's one of the best engineers I've worked with and it warms my
heart to see him thriving.

We finish our first round of suds and Dusty offers me a Graham Cracker Porter
from Denver Beer Company, which is quite lovely on this crisp Wyoming
winter evening. In between catching up he tells me a story about ol' Charlie
there getting hisself into a mighty big pickle. One day while enjoying the great
Wyoming outdoors Charlie snooted his snoot where his snoot don't belong. Now as the
owner of a hound who descends from the Basset family, I understand that their
combination of curiosity and stubbornness will lead them to snoot their snoot
wherever they damn please. And wherever they damn please is *everywhere*.

Unfortunately, on this fateful day his choice of snootin' happened to be a
Conibear trap. A type of critter trap that's designed to "quickly and humanely
dispatch an animal once the trap activates." They are spring loaded with
enough force to snap an average animal's neck.

Well, buddy, Charlie ain't no
average animal. He's got a neck like a Pamplona bull. That isn't to say it wasn't
a close run thing. Shelly found him collapsed and wheezing as the contraption
clamped down on his beefy neck. She called Dusty, who, when he got the call,
assumed he'd have to deal with a noble hound slain dead in his prime. He retrieved the
setting tool anyhow and mercifully released Sir Charles from the torment of his
iron necklace.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">The Jaws of Life would dent its blades on that neck</figcaption>
</figure>

I couldn't help but laugh at poor Charlie. It made me feel better that he was
safe & sound on his bed while Dusty regaled the harrowing tale. He's one tough SOB.
After supper I hit the hay, my first night to ever lay my head in Wyoming.
I already feel like a cowboy.

<p class="section-divider my-4">&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;</p>

I wake up refreshed, ready for another first. Today we're ice
fishing, the prospect of which has me happier than the Wisconsin offensive line
on a fullback dive. I fill my
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/06-seattle.html?id=thermos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stanley thermos</a> with jitter juice and
stand around unhelpfully
watching Dusty load and prep everything for the day on the slab. Once we're all
packed up we hit the road for Upper Sunshine Lake, a fitting name for the
beautiful Wyoming day we've got.

On the way
Dusty points out Kanye's (yes that Kanye) 27 bedroom ranch. Ye bought the ranch
2019 amid plans to build Cody into a manufacturing hub for his clothing line.
If you haven't heard of this, you could be forgiven, as he put the properties up
for sale in 2021,
<a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a36255667/kanye-west-cody-wyoming-impact/"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fewer than two years</a>
after being anointed as an
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/23/style/kanye-west-cody-wyoming.html"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">economic savior</a>
to the region. The cynic in me thinks the entire spectacle was a boondoggle from the
beginning, a narcissistic episode from a man whose attachment to reality
is *tenuous*. A more charitable interpretation would point to his divorce
proceedings as an incitement to reallocate assets. But I'm not one to speculate.

Anyways, the hour long drive feels like 10 minutes
with the spectacular views, lively conversation, and good coffee. Off the main
road we start up dirt trail 'round the side of a bluff that overlooks the lake.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">I can think of worse places to spend a day</figcaption>
</figure>

Dusty backs the truck up to the lake's edge and we hop out. He says we'd be fine
to take the truck out on the ice - it's over 2 ft thick right now - but he never
risks it in an overabundance of caution. I agree, walking an extra 30 yards
seems like a decent tradeoff to eliminate the chance, however small, of a sunken
truck. We grab the gear and a couple
chairs and set out across the ice. He warned me about the sounds I would hear
but it's really hard to properly describe. The best I can think of is some sort
of sci-fi laser being fired. It's a strange, deep, echo-y aural phenomenon that
you seem to *feel* more than *hear*. Oh yeah there's also the sounds
of cracking ice. Don't go ice fishing if you're prone to panic attacks.

Dusty scopes out a honey hole and we quickly confirm that we absolutely do **not**
have to worry
about falling through the ice. I'd actually prefer the ice were thinner since,
unlike some of the other sportsman on the lake, Dusty has yet to
invest in an automated auger. So we trade off
boring a hole using nothing but elbow grease. It takes damn near 15 minutes of
sweatin' to punch through the ice but we finally make it.

Dusty ties me off a paddle bug & baits my hook with a fresh mealworm before I drop
her down the hatch. He instructs me to let it hit bottom, reel up about a foot and
just kinda bob it there till I get a bite. Sounds easy enough. So I post up in
a chair & bob my reel while enjoying the gorgeous weather - 40 degrees without a
cloud in the sky. Dusty gets to work boring his hole and it's even more of a slog
than mine. I offer to help but he's having none of it, Wyoming folk are like
that.

Before Dusty is even done drilling his hole I nab my first aquatic vertebrate. I
reel that sucker in and, being the city boy that I am,
don't really know how you're supposed to hold a fish. So I just stand there
with the Yellowstone cutthroat dangling from the line like a doofus.
Dusty tells me to hold the stinkin' fish so I grab
him like a football and pose for a photo that looks like I'm playing a fish
guitar. Softer than baby shit.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Slappa da baaaaaasssssssss!!!</figcaption>
</figure>

Dusty finally gets his hole punched and takes a breather before dropping in his
line. Before you know it Dusty gets on the board and shows me how to hold
a fish like you've done it before.

"Oh damn, that's how you're supposed to hold it. I look like an idiot"

"Yeah, I wasn't gonna say anything"

Too damn nice to tell me I look like a moron.

My next trout I pull the hook out of that sucker's mouth and hold him out there
the proper way. Third time's a charm. Dusty bags a few more and I get another
to get my total to 4. The wind has started to pick up and it starts to get a bit
chilly as the sun dips lower in the sky. You can see me getting more bundled up
each successive fish I catch.

After about 4 hours on the ice we start to slowly pack up camp. But we can't
leave just yet, I have developed a Captain Ahab-level obsession with my white
whale. A fish right below me has been fattening himself up by nabbing the bait
right off my hook. I've re-baited it a half dozen times and the little fucker
keeps taunting me. Then finally, as the shadows are getting longer, on try 7..
or 8... or 10... I finally reel him in. And he sure is a beaut. Totally worth it.

</figure>

After my successful hunt out on the high seas we pack up the last of the gear
and head back into town. We stop off at WYOld West Brewing Company in Powell
for a round of suds and some vittles to go. I order up a flight while the food
is cookin', which hits the spot after
a good day on the ice. We finish the beers and it's back to the house
for supper and a little shuteye.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Yellowstone(ish)</h4>
The next morning I wake up bright and early for my journey to Jackson to get
back to the slopes. 6 months
out of the year that journey takes around 4 hours. The other 6 months it takes
over 6 hours. Bet you can guess which part of the year we're in. The more direct
route cuts through Yellowstone via a park road that's closed for the winter. The
more circuitous route adds 120 miles to a 200 mile journey.

Well... as long as we're going out of the way why don't we *really* go out of
the way. The route I'll be galloping transects the road leading up
to the East Entrance to Yellowstone, let's see how close we can get to our
nation's first
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/07-redwood.html?id=parks"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Park</a>, which just so
happens to be celebrating its 250th anniversary.

I say my farewells to Dusty and family & hit the road. It's about a half hour
to Cody, where I cruise through the kitschy downtown of old-timey saloons,
Western themed steakhouses, and, of course, the Cody Dug Up Gun Museum. Wait...
What? **THE CODY DUG UP GUN MUSEUM!!!??** Well shit, I guess we're making this
long trip even longer.

I park the rig and saunter up to the Cody Dug Up Gun Museum with a shit-eatin'
grin that will one day have a statue at the Cody Shit-Eatin' Grin Museum.

And then calamity strikes. New, horrific information is brought to light, man...
I can't believe I'm saying this but it is with the utmost chagrin that I must
report to you, dear reader, that the Cody Dug Up Gun Museum is closed for the
winter.

<div style="width:80%; height:0; padding-bottom:45%; position:relative; margin: 0 auto;">
  <div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="22904868" data-share-method="host" data-aspect-ratio="2" data-width="100%"></div>
  <script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>
</div>

Can you imagine all the dug up guns I could have seent? They's like
regular guns, 'cept some fellers has dug 'em up. I would have been like a...
well... like an adult in a dug up gun museum. I assume that all the guns they's
got on display are donations since they have no money leftover to *buy* guns on
account of spending all their money coming up with a name for the museum.

Dusty tells me that Cody swells every summer with tourists headed for
Yellowstone and hordes of nerds who dress up in goofy clothes and think the
"Wild West" was some fun sort of time and not a desperate, dangerous, and
hardscrabble existence forged by tough people, many of whom were running away
from something or someone. But yeah pal, enjoy your ice cold beer from a clean
glass in an air conditioned "saloon" with the time since your last shower and
hot meal counted in hours not weeks. Be my guest.

On the other side of town I head West on US-14 Buffalo Bill Scenic Byway towards
Yellastone instead of the more prudent route of WY-120 South around
Yellastone and toward Jackson. Just West of town
I reach the entrance to the Shoshone Canyon leading to the Buffalo Bill reservoir at
the Easternmost edge of the Yellowstone Plateau. Just before reaching a tunnel
that dives into the heart of the Northern flank of the canyon I pull off at
an observation point to get a better look.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Gorgeous</figcaption>
</figure>

The thrusting rock faces brood ominously over the bubbling waters of the
North Fork of the Shoshone River. The canyon feels like it's lying patiently
for the perfect opportunity to swallow you up in its craggy
jaws. It's certainly a dramatic welcome for the thousands of yearly visitors to 
the park. I wander back to the car and continue West along the banks
of the river. It's a lonely drive, only a fool would
find themselves traversing this meandering stretch of pavement that terminates
in a closed gate.

The solitude abates once I round a corner and find a few dozen new friends
grazing on and around the road. I stop for a bit to observe their
laconic loitering. They occasionally glance my way but are otherwise unbothered
by the presence of yet another steel bison on their turf. After snapping a few
photos I nose my way through the crowd and continue my journey.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Well, hello budday</figcaption>
</figure>

A dozen or so more scenic miles and I reach the end of the road. I expected a
sort of guard hut with a closed gate but I did not expect to find myself
face-to-face with a 4' wall of snow.

</figure>

With clear roads and a steed full of oats the journey to Jackson, WY should take
a mere 3 hours from this particular spot.
With snowed-in roads we're looking at a monotonous 6 hours.
But that's the maddening thing about wintertime mountain
travel. You can drive yourself crazy comparing the route the crow flies with
the route the steel bison rumbles.

Despite the added travel time my little detour was certainly worth it. I may
have to come back to pay Dusty a summertime visit to fully explore Yellowstone.
I riverside the car and head right back from whence I came about an hour to the
Southwestern edge of Cody. I hook a right headed south on WY-120 to the town of
Shoshoni where I make another right to set my bearings westward on US-26,
finally actually headed in the right direction.

Very soon after leaving Shoshoni I enter the wide valley of the Wind River Indian
Reservation. To my right lie the peaks of the Absaroka Mountains, the jewel of the
Shoshone National Forest, our first federally protected National Forest. To my
left stands the Wind River Range, the craggy remnants of a
granitic batholith that time has eroded into a jagged cordillera. The flagship of
the Wind River Range is Gannett Peak, the highest point in Wyoming and the home
of the largest single glacier in the American Rockies.

As I tumble over the other the Continental Divide at Togwotee Pass can just make
out the sawtoothed crest of the Teton Range. Another half hour and I reach the base of
the mountains, where I pull off at an observation point near the shore of Jackson
Lake. Across the pond I watch the serrated blade of the
Tetons cleave the low ceiling of an overcast Wyoming sky.

</figure>

<h4 class="article-subheader" id="jackson">Jackson</h4>

I spend an unreasonable amount of time enjoying the view and gorgeous weather
before I pour myself back into the car for
the short drive to Jackson. This town is new to me and upon an initial inventory
it seems every other shop has the word "Outfitters" in the name. The types of
places that cater to Lloyd Christmas after scooping up a briefcase full of money
in Aspen. I'm pretty wiped so I just mosey on through. We have a couple days to
explore. Today I'm headed for the town of Victor, ID, another 25 miles west over the
southern flank of the Tetons. All the campsites for miles around were booked up
but I was able to find a tiny cabin for about the same rate. This pleases me.

As I make my way over Teton Pass I'm blessed with a clear view of the
scenery. You ain't gotta have too active an imagination to see how this
road can get awful hairy awful quick when the weather rolls in. A half hour and
one state later I arrive at the Teton Valley Resort where I check in to my
tiny cabin. It has no running water but they's got facilities in the bathhouse
across the car park. Plus it's got a fridge to keep my beer cold and a little
aroma diffuser to keep my olfactories satisfied. It's my little slice of
heaven.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Home sweet home</figcaption>
</figure>

After I get all settled in I throw on my trunks and grab a few brewskis for a
quick dip in the hot tub. I meet a couple who are traveling around in their RV
visiting National Parks, shredding some pow, and overall enjoying life on the
road. Courtney augments their income by taking professional photos for the
various places they stay. She gets a few shots of Travis and me in the hot tub
but when I check their Instagram later they are nowhere to be seen. Probably a
good decision.

After finishing off my cache of beers I bid my new friends adieu and head across
the lot for some shuteye.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Jackson<s>'s</s> Hole</h4>
Jackson Hole is it. It's the silver tuna. It's the reason I upgraded my Ikon
pass this year. It's a place thats revered among skiers all over the world.
It's been at the top of my (domestic) ski destination list for
a couple years so I'm glad to finally check it off.

I wake up bright and early and hit the road to the hill. Up & over the pass
towards Jackson then a left at the Snake River. Another 5 miles
North & I turn into Teton Village. The resort avails itself to some remarkable
geology - you can bomb 80 mph down WY-390 in the flat plain of the Snake
River valley then one turn and a quarter mile later you're at the base of the
gondola. In terms of accessibility you can't beat it.

I am quite early so I pass the time at a coffee shop in the mountain village before
the opening bell. Promptly at 9 AM I hop on the Aerial Tram for a quick scoot up
one of the top-10 longest ski lifts in North America. Atop Rendezvous Mountain
I dive off
the left side of the precipice to the Rendezvous Bowl. Let me know if you've
heard this one before... but the snow is shit. They haven't gotten fresh flakes
in weeks so the run is ridiculously tracked out. They've had some freeze/thaw
cycles as well so we're dealing with heaps of ice & crud. We've turned the page into
March but this seems a tad early for spring skiing.

I find a way to maneuver down the bowl and drop into Bivouac, where I almost
blow a tyre on some ice. At this point it would be an understatement to say my
first exposure to Jackson Hole has been *less than
ideal*. It's a shame I have to see her in these conditions. Damn shame.

I make my way to the Thunder Quad chair & back up I go, not quite to the tippy
top. I drop into the *Laramie Bowl*, which actually skis pretty nice. Alright,
looks like we've found our honey hole. A perfectly good stretch of
wonderful skiing tucked away between the nightmares that keep skiers up at
night. Any sensible human being would simply go back there. And that's exactly
what I was planning to do. Which makes
my next decision all the more puzzling. As I'm cruising across the South Pass
Traverse towards Thunder Quad I impulsively drop into South Colter Ridge.

It looked nice from the traverse.

*Narrator:* It wasn't nice.

The snow, where present, is crunchy. The ice, where plentiful, spans the gaps
between myriad rocks. The more surreptitious stones conceal
themselves behind the snowy hummocks of obstinate moguls, greeting me as I round
the corner of each icy burg.

Knee clattering turn after knee clattering turn inches the needle of my
*I'm-sick-of-this-shit* meter closer and
closer to max exasperation. As I approach the end of the run the needle breaks
plum off and I make a run for it. Full send,
straight line, french fry when you're supposed to pizza. Which isn't a problem
until I crest a ridge at the bottom, revealing a mogul field that was hidden
from view when I decided to turn on the afterburners.

*Narrator:* Now he's in **big** <span class="fs-4 fw-bold">BIG</span> trouble

At this point I am *hauling ass*. With
my pace I have no hope of slowing down, lest I crash ass over teakettle on a
mogul. My only hope is to just charge right through those bastards and hope for
the best.

I'm not saying I looked like Johnny Moseley ripping over those bumps (because
I unequivocally did not) but I certainly felt like him. The humps were charging
fast and hard, my legs humming like a sewing machine. Bing-bang-boom-bop! I
nearly yard sale'd a dozen times, but by god I made it down by the skin of my
teeth. It weren't smooth. It
weren't drinkable. But that's what's it's good about it. I can't imagine what
the family who was riding up the bunny hill lift above me were thinking.

At the bottom I catch my breath and make an offering to the ski gods.

Our powder  
Who art in shreddage  
Hallowed by thy send...

I take a quick roll call of all my bones and tendons and ligaments and
everybody shows up for duty. With all the smugness of George Clooney after
heisting the Bellagio I hop on the Union Pass Quad chair. All glory to me.

Back at the base area I dump myself into the Bridger Gondola to work
my way over to the other side of the hill.

Bridger Gondola  
&emsp;to Sweetwater Gondola  
&emsp;&emsp;to Casper Quad  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to Teton Quad  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to Apr&egrave;s Vous Quad  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to wait... where are we again??

Suffice to day I make a pretty thorough tour of Jackson's cableways.
And actually found some decent patches of snow to boot.
My favorite run was probably Crags Run, solely based on the fact that had the
best snow I found anywhere on the mountain. More than once a fellow lift rider
mentions that the Saratoga Bowl is their favorite little oasis
over here but it's currently closed due to the spotty conditions.

After cruising around the Northern flank of the resort I meander back around where
I started. But not before a quick pit stop at the Rendezvous Lodge for a backpack
PB&J and a deliciously crisp Pilsgnar pilsner from Melvin Brewing in
Alpine, Wyoming. I've been an acolyte of Melvin since my San Anonio neighbors
Mike & Lizzie poured me a pint upon returning from a visit to
their Cowboy State cabin. It's magical stuff.

<div id="slop"></div>

By this point in the day the weather has become downright balmy. It's not
uncommon to see folks stripped down to their t-shirts. While this may be nice
weather for a weekend down the shore, it's not conducive for sports that rely on
water retaining its solid crystalline structure. Like the second day of a
bachelor party in Detroit things have gotten *sloppy*. Not only is the snow
coverage low, the snow that we do have is melting away with no consideration for
my merriment. I'm stricken with a sense of *Weltschmerz* once again.

I sigh and do the only thing I know how to do. Have a blast.

I head back to the Laramie Bowl for a couple more spins on my *second*
favorite run out here. While I'm in the area I catch a ride on the Sublette
Quad, rounding out my tour of Jackson Hole chairlifts, gondolas, and trams.
At the bottom I catch one last ride on the tram to the
apex for a decent line back down the *Rendezvous Bowl*. All told I skied
32,380' of vertical, a damn nice day considering the shit conditions. I believe
I've earned myself a cold beer.

The aforementioned Mike & Lizzy recommended I check out Million Dollar
Cowboy whilst I'm up here so I load up the car & head that-a-way. I stroll up to
the saloon and find that I'll have to hold my horses. Bar's closed for a
Jennifer Nettles concert, she of Sugarland fame. I spit and curse my luck, gazing
around the town square for another watering hole.

Just across the intersection
I see a group of people on a second floor balcony engaging in mirthful revelry.
I sidle over to Roadhouse Brewing where I order myself a Highwayman pilsner, a
fitting tipple for the 8,500 miles I've stacked up on the trip. The barmaid
strikes up a conversation when she sees my Bills touque - turns out she's from
Buffalo herself so we ruefully discuss
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/06-seattle.html?id=13-seconds"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 Seconds</a>,
and how damn good Josh Allen looks in shorts.

After our Nickel City digressions I join the bacchants on the balcony. If you
were to create the archetypical setting for a patio pilsner this would probably be it.
The sun shining through a cloudless Wyoming afternoon, the air crisp and cool.
Families are frolicking in the park in the center of town. Couples are peering
into shops before supper. A quaint vivacity exudes from the town square. An
edenic big little town evening.

I slurp down my beer and find my steed tied up at the trough out front.
Back up & over the pass to Idaho we go, back to my tiny cabin. I plop in
the tub another soak before warshin' up for supper. Lucky for me there's a cool
looking joint only about a mile up the road called West Side Yard that's got a
barstool with my name on it. Upon a quick inventory of the menu I notice a
Cicerone's Choice
section. Today's selection is the Retreat Hazy IPA from Offshoot Beer Company
in Placentia, CA, a *"DIPA brewed with a simple malt bill and hopped heavily
with fruit-forward Mosaic, Cashmere, and El Dorado. Laced with delicate and
aromatic tropical notes along with a bright berry medley and a crisp mouthfeel"*.
Hot damn, I'll take one of those!

As I fill my moustache with crispy foamy froth I peruse the vittles section of
the menu. My eyes immediately fall to the wings and it hits me that I
haven't had wings this entire trip. 2 months on the road and not a single order
of wings. By god I need to remedy that sad state of affairs.

Wings, hot. Bleu cheese. Carrots & celery. Heaven.

I have to say the wait was worth it. I don't know if it's because I have been
trapped in a wing-less desert of supply chain shortages but these wangs *slap*.
They go down all the better with my fancy ass beer. A beer so tasty I
order another just to be on the safe side. It's the perfect end to a big day on
the mountain. I polish off the wings and the brewski and make the short trek
back to the cabin to call it a night.

<h4 class="article-subheader">I'm Goin' Back to Jackson</h4>
I've got a feel for the mountain now, unfortunately the mountain's got a feel for
warmth. It's going to be even hotter today. Yuck.

I pack up my gear and head back to the Hole. I'm not
as early today so I have to park in an overflow lot & take the shuttle. I waddle
up to the tram and jump aboard with 99 of my closest friends. 9 minutes and
4,139 vertical feet later I shuffle off and strap on my gear. I plan to head
back to Rendezvous Bowl but not before a quick detour.

Corbet's Couloir is the most infamous run at Jackson and has been described as
America's scariest ski slope. It's named after Jackson Hole ski instructor
Barry Corbet, who remarked in 1960 upon seeing the chute that "someday someone
will ski that." That someday didn't happen until the next presidential
administration... but
that's just because the guy who was in charge... well he had a bad weekend in
Dallas. Perhaps skiing Corbet's was one of the "other things" we chose to due
in that decade, because patroller Lonnie Ball skied it in 1967. *Not because
it was easy but because it was hard*. So hard that it has been the scene of
thousands of whoopsies, wipeouts, and yard sales in the years since.

Once I fully relieve myself of the delusion that I *could* ski it if the snow were
better (I couldn't) I riverside back to Rendezvous. It skis much the same as
it did yesterday, crusty, bumpy, but manageable. I spend the morning bouncing
around the South side
of the hill, bopping between the Sublette Quad & Thunder Quad chairs.

Once the early afternoon rolls around the temperatures start to get uncomfortably
warm. My ass gets swampy and the snow gets soupy. Near the
bottom of the Casper Quad I duck into a run called Nez Perce, which was
undoubtedly the worst decision of the day. My first
turn I sink waist deep into the slush and endure the saddest, slowest
wipeout in the history of alpine skiing. It was like trying to walk through a
river of molasses oozing down a hill. To add to the tragedy it was directly below
a passing tram car. I gather my pride, and my skis, and set off back down the
hill. And fall three more times. Three more comically slow tumbles that would
make an outside observer question if the force of gravity had been somehow
altered.

I mercifully make it to the bottom of the run and the rest of the way home on
Lower Sundance is a nice, easy cruise. I reach the base of the mountain and
glance up at the thermometer at the tram loading station.

<div id="hot"></div>

###### 52&deg;F

#### 52&deg;!!! WTF!

It's hotter than Joey Slowgano's break pads at Talladaga, dadgum! I wipe the
sweat off my brow and dash any inkling I may have had about going back out there.
I unclip my skis with another 22,680' under my belt and stroll over to the
Mangy Moose to cool off with a cold beer.

<figure class="figure d-table mx-auto">

    <figcaption class="figure-caption" style="display:table-caption;caption-side:bottom;">Not a bad day</figcaption>
</figure>

It's soon apparent that I'm not the only one who's flown to the Moose for the
winter. This place is *packed*. I eye a spot at the far knuckle of the bar and slide
in before someone else can snatch it. I order a Pilsgnar from trusty ol' Melvin
Brewing and strike up a conversation with the fella next to me. I'd guess he's
in his early 60's, sporting a plaid jacket and red stocking cap to accompany
his welcoming smile. "Poland" he replies when I ask where he hails from, to
which I give him a hard cheers with my pint glass.

I have yet to have a bad time drinking beer with any of my Polish brothers and
sisters and this is no exception. We exchange niceties - I learn that he's lived
in Wyoming the last 20 years - he learns that I've been on the road the last 2
months. It doesn't take long for the conversation to careen into the deep,
roiling waters of his hatred for Russia. Rightfully so. He lived through the
death throes of the Soviet Union and the chaotic aftermath of its implosion. He
wouldn't piss on Vlad Putin if he was on fire. He's fantastic.

We eventually circle back to Poland and all the places I need to visit. I
order another beer just so I can chat with him longer. I don't catch his name
as I leave the Moose but I'm going to guess it's Stanislaus. Damn fine name
Stanislaus.

I saddle up and head into town, hoping that the Million Dollar Cowboy is open
to the public today. I pull into the town square and find that I'm in luck. I
push open the swangin' doors to reveal the most obscenely garish cacophony
of Hollywood cowboy kitsch you could possibly imagine. It's like a Rainforest
Cafe for adults who think *The Adventures of Davy Crockett*
was a documentary. It's equal parts preposterous and marvelous. I sidle up to
the bar & straddle the stool, which, of course, is a saddle. I
order the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar Golden Ale, because when in Rome. Assuming
Rome is Andy's toybox from Toy Story.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">I love/hate this place more than this place loves tassels</figcaption>
</figure>

I enjoy my ale among a smattering of blue hairs watching the mediocre country
music act on the stage at the far end of the bar. A few saddles down a group
of greenhorns saunters up who is *fucking blown away* by the barstools. They hop,
and in the case of one particular woman, crawl aboard. In what I'm presuming to
be a long & storied history, saddle design has never attempted to accommodate a
creature of her stature. And perhaps more pertinent, horse design has never
dared try to accommodate a creature of her stature. For to mount a horse requires
a certain degree of *litheness*. This woman lacks litheness. When horses lay
their horse heads down at night, they thank their horse gods they have yet to
hoist this woman upon their spine. The metal post upon which her saddle resides
groans beneath her immense heft. She's bopping around, clapping nowhere near
the beat. I can't tell if she's drunk as hell or just stupid and happy.

I polish off my suds and skedaddle out of there. I like to think Mike & Lizzy
knew that the Million Dollar Cowboy would be the perfect clash for my cynical
disposition and affinity for all things silly. I know for
sure that I would have a fantastic time at the Million Dollar Cowboy with Mike &
Lizzy and that's what's I appreciates abouts them. I saddle up & mosey on back
over the pass for the cabin.
Until something catches my eye. A sign. Or rather a glimpse of a sign. Just off
the side of the highway. Unless I'm seeing things I believe it said **BREWERY
&#8680;**. I blew past it at highway speeds but spin around at a gas station a
quarter mile down the road to give it another look-see. I soon find that my
hunch was true, here lies a brewery. Well I'll be damned.

I ramble down the short drive to the brewhouse & park my rig out front. I stroll
into the cozy tasting room of Grand Teton Brewing, where I order up a flight of
their tasty brews. A fella at the bar strikes up a conversation
and it turns out he's one of the brewers just hangin' out for a couple pints
before heading home. My new friend Dillon asks how the skiing's been
and when he hears about the abysmal conditions he laughs and doesn't feel so
bad being cooped up in the brewery all day.

We discuss beer, skiing, traveling. When he learns that I'm headed to Utah
tomorrow he tosses out a crazy idea. Seeing as the conditions at Jackson are
proper shit, it might behoove me forego Jackson tomorrow & check out Pine Creek
instead. Pine Creek Ski Resort is
a small, independently owned ski area about halfway to Salt Lake. It has
30 runs and a single lift, but perhaps its most intriguing feature is the fact
that mid-week *you can rent out the entire mountain*. You read that right, 
every Monday - Thursday during ski season you can rent out the entire mountain
for a few thousand bucks. I don't know when but I'm getting a group together one
of these days & we're renting out that damn mountain.

I snag a 6-er of Juicy IPA for my travels and wish the fellers goodbye. It's a
short journey to the cabin where I call it an early night in my comfy abode.

<p class="section-divider my-4">&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;</p>

I wake up bright and early and hit the road South
with a full tank of gas and a fresh cup of coffee. I follow the Snake River for
about an hour until the town of Alpine, home of Melvin Brewing, right on the
shores of the Palisades Reservoir. Unfortunately the brewery isn't open this
early in the morn' so I continue tramping south as the Snake veers eastward,
towards its headwaters in the Tetons & Yellowstone.

</figure>

Another 90 minutes of driving finds me in the town of Cokeville, WY, where I
make a left turn for the 5 mile drive through farmland and muddy roads to the
ski area. It's technically called "Pine Creek Ski Resort" but we'll
refraining from calling it a ski "resort" because a
resort it most certainly is not. But that's just how they like it. The unpaved
parking lot sits below a modest lodge that stands abreast to the loading area
for a single chairlift. With 640 skiable acres and
1,450' of vertical this little operation ain't nothin' to sneeze at!
I cross my fingers that the light flurries we're getting today keep up.

Plus checkout their kickass logo.

<figure class="figure d-table mx-auto">

    <figcaption class="figure-caption" style="display:table-caption;caption-side:bottom;">Hell yeah brother</figcaption>
</figure>
I gear up and purchase a reasonably priced lift ticket from the ticket sales/ski
rental/ski shop/guest services all-in-one counter. Besides a couple other carloads
the only other visitors at the mountain today are a class of middle-school aged
kids who arrived here on a schoolbus. I'm not sure if they are on early
Spring Break or they can skip out on school on Fridays in the winter but either
way I'm super jealous. Half are mulling about the lodge and the other half are
in varying states of alpine athletics. I'd say at most there are 40 people here
today but it's probably closer to 30. That's over 20 acres for the each of us!

I click into my planks & hit the chair, which I guess is just called THE chair
since it's the only one out here. *I've been through the desert on a chair with
no name*. The ride up is surprisingly long - a 12 minute jaunt at 3.8 miles per
hour, a leisurely stroll compared to the 16 mph of the Jackson tram or 10 mph of
the high speed quads. But despite the unhurried pace of the lift it's quite
peaceful. Just you, your thoughts, and the serenity of a rural Wyoming mountain.
The lift operator hut is manned by an older fella with a bushy red beard and a
cheery smile. I give him a wave and he returns
the favor with a warmth & friendliness that makes you feel welcome at Pine Creek.

Off the lift I head over to skiers right - because I've got nothing better to
do - and find myself on a thin carpet of snow rolled out between the rocks. It's not
great and an inauspicious start to the day. Things improve on the next run when
I stay a little closer to the lift & find some good snow. I stay in this area the
next few runs, dipping into some glades that have held the
snow shockingly well. In general, the snow coverage is pretty poor, but this
section of the mountain is better than most places I've skied
on this trip. Granted, that's a low bar, but a bar nonetheless.

On the drive in from I got a call from my good buddy Landon about the birth of
his first child. In the course of the congratulations and transcendental musings
of fatherhood he asked if I've
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/04-bend.html?id=rain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gotten rained on again</a>.
I laughed & told him no, confident that my days of rain skiing were behind me.
Well obviously the skiing gods were listening and took little time to punish me
for my hubris. On my 7th run the flurries turn to rain, my mood from cheery to
sour.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">He couldn't just leave well enough alone</figcaption>
</figure>

By this point the old fella in the lift operator hut has started giving me
preemptive waves each time he
sees me coming up to the apex of the hill so at least I got that goin' for me.
Despite the hospitality the rain is too much to overlook and I decide to call
it a day. Just a hair under 10k vertical feet but nary a lift line or run crowded
full of Jerrys. I'd call that an alright day.

I unstrap my gear in the muddy parking lot and continue southward. My
destination is the town of Hollday, Utah, a leafy suburb of Salt Lake City. The
town sits right at the base of the Wasatch Range, the home of a number of world-class
ski resorts. I'll be staying at the home of my mom's friend LaGayle and her
husband Bob who have graciously opened
their home to an unemployed rambler such as I (after I invited myself, of
course). The last time I saw Bob & LaGayle was when we visited them over spring
break in 2001, so a visit is *long* overdue. When we came out they were already
setting up for the Winter Olympics the following year, the highlight of which
was the ski jump ramps that were constructed just north of Canyons Ski Resort.

It's a smooth 2.5 hour drive to Bob & LaGayle's, where I arrive right before
sundown. I tie the ol' gal up at the hitchin' post out front and   my
my travel-weary bones up to their beautiful home, eager to call the same bed
home for a week straight. Forecast calls for snow. Let's do this.
