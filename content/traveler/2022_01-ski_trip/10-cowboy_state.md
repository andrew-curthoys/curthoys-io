<h4 class="article-subheader">Cowboy State</h4>
As Randy jets off back to Vegas I hit the road due East on I-90 bound for
Powell, Woming, a little town outside Cody. Awaiting me in Powell is Dusty, another
former co-worker who has foolishly invited me to stay with him and his lovely
family. It's a nice, easy 3 hour cruise where I arrive right before supper. I
meet Dusty's wonderful wife Shelly and three admirable youngsters Zach, a senior
in high school committed to the University of Wyoming, Kenzie, a sophomore in
high school, and Addy, a 6th grader. Can't forget about Sage River the
Goldendoodle, and my best bud Charlie, a cantankerous Basset Hound after my
own heart.

Dusty offers me a Cold Smoke Scotch Ale from KettleHouse Brewing in Missoula
and we catch up about the past few years. He's a Wyoming man through & through,
which of course makes him a fan of Big Josh (despite the sad fact that he's a
Patriots fan. Yuck). Since he moved back to Wyoming a few years ago he's
been happy as a clam. He was one of the best engineers I worked with and it warms
my heart to see him & his family thriving.

We finish our first round of suds and Dusty offers me a Graham Cracker Porter
from Denver Beer Company, which is actually quite nice on this lovely Wyoming
winter evening. He tells me a story about Charlie getting himself caught in a
Conibear trap, a type of critter trap that's designed to "quickly and humanely
dispatch the animal once the trap activates." They are spring loaded with
enough force to snap an average animal's neck. Well, buddy, Charlie ain't no
average animal. He's got a neck like a Pamplona bull. That isn't to say it wasn't
a close run thing. Shelly found him collapsed and wheezing as the contraption
clamped down on his beefy neck. She called Dusty, who assumed he'd have to
dispose of a dead dog when he got the call. He retrieved the
setting tool anyhow and mercifully released Sir Charles from his iron necklace
tormentor.

</figure>

I couldn't help but laugh at poor Charlie. It made me feel better that he was
safe & sound on his bed while Dusty regaled the harrowing tale. He's one tough SOB.
After supper I hit the hay, my first night to ever lay my head in Wyoming.
I already feel like a cowboy.

<p class="section-divider my-4">&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;</p>

I wake up refreshed, ready for another first. Today we're ice
fishing, the prospect of which has me happier than the Wisconsin offensive line
on a fullback dive. I fill my
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/06-seattle.html?id=thermos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stanley thermos</a> to the brim with jitter juice and stand around unhelpfully
watching Dusty load and prep everything for the day on the slab. Once he gets
everything packed up we hit the road headed for Upper Sunshine Lake. On the way
Dusty points out Kanye's 27 bedroom ranch, which he bought in 2019 during amid
plans to build Cody into a manufacturing hub for his clothing line. All that
seems to have gone out the window, putting the properties up for sale in 2021,
seemingly not unrelated to his divorce from Kim K. But I'm not one to speculate.

The drive to the lake is a little over an hour but it doesn't seem that long
with the spectacular views, lively conversation, and good coffee. Near the lake
we start up dirt road up the side of a low mountain to the lake.

</figure>

Dusty backs the truck up to the lake's edge and we hop out. He says we'd be fine
to take the truck out on the ice - it's over 2 ft thick right now - but he never
risks it in an overabundance of caution. I agree, walking an extra 30 yards
seems like a decent tradeoff for a sunken truck. We grab the gear and a couple
chairs and set out across the ice. He warned me about the sounds I would hear
but it's really hard to properly describe. The best I can think of is some sort
of sci-fi laser being fired. It's a strange, deep, echo-y aural phenomenon that
seems like you *feel* it more than *hear* it. Oh yeah there's also the sounds
of cracking ice. Don't go ice fishing if you're prone to a panic attack.

We find a honey hole and quickly find that we absolutely do not have to worry
about falling through the ice. I'd actually prefer if the ice wasn't quite as
thick because, unlike some of the other sportsman on the lake, Dusty has yet to
invest in an automated auger for drilling a hole in the ice. So we trade off
boring a hole using nothing but elbow grease. It takes damn near 15 minutes of
sweatin' to punch through the ice but we finally make it.

Dusty ties me off a paddle bug & baits my hook with a paddlebug lure and a fresh
mealworm before I drop
her down the hatch. He instructs me to let it hit bottom, reel up about a foot and
just kinda bob it there till I get a bite. Sounds easy enough. So I post up in
a chair & bob my reel while enjoying the gorgeous weather, 40 degrees without a
cloud in the sky. Dusty gets to work on his hole and it's even more of a slog
than mine. I offer to help but he's having none of it, Wyoming folk are like
that.

Before Dusty is even done drilling his hole I nab my first aquatic vertebrate. I
reel that sucker in and, being the city boy that I am,
I don't really know how you're supposed to hold a fish so I just stand there
with the Yellowstone cutthroat dangling from the line for a pic.
Dusty tells me to hold him so I grab
him like a football and pose for a photo that looks like I'm playing a fish
guitar. Softer than baby shit.

Dusty finally gets his hole punched and takes a breather before dropping in his
line. I nab another one then Dusty gets on the board and shows me how to hold
a fish like you've done it before.

"Oh damn, that's how you're supposed to hold it. I look like an idiot"

"Yeah, I wasn't gonna say anything"

Too damn nice to tell me I look like a moron.

My next trout I pull the hook out of that sucker's mouth and hold him out there
the proper way. Third time's a charm. Dusty bags a few more and I get another
to get my total to 4. The wind has started to pick up and it starts to get a bit
chilly as the sun dips lower in the sky. You can see me getting more bundled up
each successive fish I catch.

After about 4 hours on the ice we start to slowly pack up camp. I have a Captain
Ahab - Moby Dick situation going on over at my hole that I need to see through.
There's a fish right below me that keeps nabbing my bait right off the hook. I've
re-baited it a half dozen times and the little fucker keeps foiling my plans.

</figure>

We finish packing up the gear and head back into town. We stop off at WYOld
West Brewing Company in Powell for a round of suds and some supper to take back to the
house. I order up a flight while the food is cookin' that hits the spot after
a good day of ice fishing. We finish the beers and it's back to the house
for supper and a little shuteye.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Yellowstone(ish)</h4>
The next morning I wake up bright and early for the journey to Jackson. Typically
it would take me a little over 4 hours, however that's via a route through
Yellowstone that's closed in the winter. The way I'm going adds 120 miles and
nearly two hours to my journey. Well as long as we're going out of the way why
don't we *really* go out of the way. I'll be going past the road that leads up
to the East Entrance to Yellowstone, why don't we see how close we can get.

I say my farewells to Dusty and family & hit the road. It's about a half hour
to Cody, where I cruise through the kitschy downtown of old-timey saloons,
Western themed steakhouses, and, of course, the Cody Dug Up Gun Museum. It's with
the utmost chagrin that I discover that the Dug Up Gun Museum is closed for the
winter. Can you imagine all the dug up guns I could have seent? They's like
regular guns, 'cept some fellers has dug 'em up. Actually, they probably ain't
got no money to buy dug up guns on accounts they's prolly spent all they's
money comin' up withs a name for the museum.

Dusty tells me that Cody swells every summer with tourists headed for
Yellowstone and hordes of nerds who dress up in goofy clothes and think the
"Wild West" was some fun sort of time and not a desperate, dangerous, and
hardscrabble existence forged by tough people, many of whom were running away
from something or someone. But yeah pal, enjoy your ice cold beer from a clean
glass in an air conditioned "saloon" with the time since your last shower and
hot meal counted in hours not weeks.

On the other side of town I head West on US-14 Buffalo Bill Scenic Byway towards
Yellastone instead of WY-120 headed South around Yellastone. Just West of town
I reach the entrance to the Shoshone Canyon leading to the Buffalo Bill reservoir at
the Easternmost edge of the Yellowstone Plateau. Just before reaching a tunnel
that dives into the heart of the Northern flank of the canyon I pull off at
an observation point to get a better look.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Gorgeous</figcaption>
</figure>

The thrusting rock faces brood ominously over the bubbling waters of the
North Fork of the Shoshone River. The canyon feels like it's lying patiently
for the perfect opportunity to swallow you up in its craggy
jaws. It's certainly a dramatic welcome for the thousands of yearly visitors to America's
first National Park. I wander back to the car and continue West along the banks
of the river. It's a lonely drive, only a fool would
find themselves traversing this meandering stretch of pavement that terminates
in a closed gate.

The solitude abates once I round a corner and find a few dozen new friends
grazing on and around the road. I stop for a few minutes to observe their
laconic loitering. They occasionally glance my way but are otherwise unbothered
by the presence of yet another steel bison on their turf. After snapping a few
photos I nose my way through the crowd and continue my journey.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Well, hello budday</figcaption>
</figure>

A dozen or so more scenic miles and I reach the end of the road. I expected a
sort of guard hut with a closed gate but I did not expect to find myself
face-to-face with a 4' wall of snow.

With clear roads and a steed full of oats the journey to Jackson, WY should take
a mere 3 hours from this particular spot.
With snowed in roads and a steed full of oats the journey to Jackson, WY is a
monotonous 6 hours from this
particular spot. But that's the maddening thing about wintertime mountain
travel. You can drive yourself mad comparing the route the crow flies with
the route the steel bison rumbles.

Despite the added travel time my little detour was certainly worth it. I may
have to come pay Dusty another visit in the summer to fully explore Yellowstone.
I riverside the car and head right back from whence I came about an hour to the
Southwestern edge of Cody, where I hook a right headed south on WY-120. It's
another hour to the town of Shoshoni where I make another right on
US-26 headed west. This takes me through the wide valley of the Wind River Indian
Reservation. To my right lie the peaks of the Absaroka Mountains, within the
Shoshone National Forest, the first federally protected National Forest in the
US, and the Wind River Range to my left, the craggy remnants of a granitic
batholith that time has eroded into a
jagged  Wind River Range to my left. The flagship of the Wind River Range is
Gannett Peak, the highest point in Wyoming and the home of the largest single
glacier in the American Rockies.

As I crest the Togwotee Pass and the Continental Divide I can just make out the
jagged crest of the Teton Range. Another half hour and I pull off at an observation
point near the shore of Jackson Lake. Across the pond stands the serrated blade of the
Tetons cleaving the low ceiling of the overcast Wyoming sky.

</figure>

Well after my scenic vista cup runneth over I pour myself back into the car for
the short drive to Jackson. This town is new to me and upon an initial inventory
it seems every other shop has the word "Outfitters" in the name. The types of
places that cater to Lloyd Christmas after scooping up a briefcase full of money
in Aspen. I'm pretty wiped so I just do a quick inventory of the town as I mosey
through. I'm headed for the town of Victor, ID, another 25 miles west, over the
southern flank of the Tetons. All the campsites for miles around were booked up
but I was able to find a tiny house cabin for about the same rate as a campsite.

I'm blessed with a clear view as I snake my way up Teton Pass. I can see this
road gettin' awful hairy awful quick when the winter weather rolls in. In about
half an hour I arrive to the Teton Valley Resort where I check in for my
tiny cabin. It has no running water so I'll need to trudge across the parking
lot to use the facilities but it's got a fridge to keep my beer cold and a little
aroma diffuser to keep my olfactories satisfied. It's my little slice of
heaven.

</figure>

After I get all settled in I throw on my trunks and grab a few brewskis for a
quick dip in the hot tub. I meet a couple who are traveling around in their RV
visiting National Parks, shredding some pow, and overall enjoying life on the
road. Courtney augments their income by taking professional photos for the
various places they stay. She gets a few shots of Dylan and me in the hot tub
but when I check their Instagram later they are nowhere to be seen. Probably a
good decision.

After finishing off my cache of beers I bid my new friends adieu and head across
the lot for some shuteye.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Jackson<s>'s</s> Hole</h4>
Jackson Hole is it. It's the silver tuna. It's the reason I upgraded my Ikon
pass this year so I could ski it. It's a place thats revered among skiers all
over the country. It's been at the top of my (domestic) ski destination list for
a couple years so I'm glad to finally check it off.

I wake up bright and early and hit the road to the hill. I hump it over the pass
headed towards Jackson then hook a left north at the Snake River. Another 5 miles
up the road I turn into Teton Village. The resort avails itself to some remarkable
geology - you could be bombing 80 mph down WY-390 in the flat plain of the Snake
River valley then one turn and a quarter mile later you're at the base of the
gondola. In terms of accessibility you can't beat it.

I am quite early so I snag a great spot in the parking lot and pass the time at
a coffee shop in the mountain village. At the opening bell I hop on the Aerial
Tram for a quick jaunt to the top of Rendezvous Mountain. Up yonder I dive off
the left side of the mountain to the Rendezvous Bowl. Let me know if you've
heard this one before... They haven't gotten fresh snow in weeks so the run is
ridiculously tracked out. They've been going through some freeze/thaw cycles as
well so we're dealing with heaps of ice & crud. We've turned the page into
March but this seems a tad early for spring skiing.

I'm able to scoot my way down the bowl and drop into Bivouac, where I almost
blow a tyre on some ice. My first exposure to Jackson Hole has been *less than
ideal*. It's a shame I have to see her in these conditions. I make my way to the
Thunder Quad chair & bak up I go, not quite to the tippy top this time. I drop
into the Laramie Bowl, which actually skis pretty nice. I'm feeling pretty good
then I blunder as I'm cruising across the South Pass Traverse. Instead of just
sliding on back to the Thunder Quad or the Marmot I impulsively
drop into the South Colter Ridge run. It looked nice from the traverse but I
soon find that it is, in fact, not nice. The snow, where present, is crunchy.
Ice spans the gaps between plentiful rocks. The more surreptitious rocks conceal
themselves behind the snowy hummocks of obstinate moguls, greeting me as I round the
corner of the bumps.

As I near the bottom of the run the needle on my
I'm-sick-of-this-shit meter breaks off and I make a run for it. Full send,
straight line, french fry when you're supposed to pizza. Which isn't a problem
until I crest a ridge at the bottom, revealing a mogul field that was hidden
from view when I decided to turn on the afterburners. This is the part of the
movie where the action pauses and I begin a narration along the lines of "I bet
you're wondering how I got myself into this situation." I am *hauling ass*. With
my pace I have no hope of slowing down, lest I crash ass over teakettle on a
mogul. My only hope is to just charge right through those bastards and hope for
the best.

I'm not saying I looked like Johnny Moseley ripping over those bumps (because
I unequivocally did not) but I certainly felt like him. The humps were charging
fast and hard, my legs humming like a sewing machine. Bing-bang-boom-bop! I
nearly yard sale'd a dozen times, but by god I made it down by the skin of my
teeth. It weren't smooth. It
weren't drinkable. But that's what's it's good about it. I can't imagine what
the family who was riding up the bunny hill lift above me were thinking.

I make an offering to the ski gods and hop on the Union Pass Quad chair, thirsty
for more. Back at the base area I dump myself into the Bridger Gondola to work
my way over to the other side of the hill.

Bridger Gondola - Sweetwater Gondola - Casper Quad - Teton Quad - Apr&egrave;s
Vous Quad

I made a pretty thorough tour of Jackson's cableways. And there were a few
patches of decent snow over here. My favorite run was probably Crags Run on
account it had the best snow I found anywhere on the mountain. A lot of the
folks I talked to on the lift said the Saratoga Bowl is their favorite honey
hole on this side but it's currently closed due to the spotty conditions.

After cruising around the Northern flank of the resort I make my way back where
I started, taking a little pit stop at the Rendezvous Lodge for a PB&J from my
backpack and a deliciously crisp Pilsgnar pilsner from Melvin Brewing in
Alpine, Wyoming. I've been an acolyte of Melvin since Mike & Lizzie, my
neighbors in San
Antonio poured me a pint upon returning from a visit to
their cabin in Wyoming. It's magical stuff.

By this point in the day the weather has become downright balmy. It's not
uncommon to see folks skiing in t-shirts. While this may be nice
weather for a weekend down the shore, it's not conducive for sports that rely on
water retaining its solid crystalline structure. Like a golf outing with the boys
it's gotten *sloppy*. Not only is the snow coverage low, the snow that we
do have is melting away with no consideration for my wellbeing. I'm going to
start overusing the word *Weltschmerz*.

I sigh and do the only thing I know how to do. Have a blast.

I head back to the Laramie Bowl for a couple more spins, probably my second favorite run
out here. While I'm in the area I catch a ride on the Sublette Quad, rounding
out my tour of
Jackson Hole chairlifts, gondolas, and trams. I catch the tram once more to the
tippy top for a decent line back down the Rendezvous Bowl. From there is a couple
more chairs and a couple more cruisy slush runs to close out the day. All told I skied
32,380' of vertical, a damn nice day considering the shit conditions. I believe
I've earned myself a cold beer.

The aforementioned Mike & Lizzy recommended I check out the Million Dollar
Cowboy saloon in town so I load up my gear & head that-a-way. I stroll up to the
swingin' doors and find that I'll have to hold my horses. Bar's closed for a
Jennifer Nettles concert, she of Sugarland fame. I spit and curse my luck, gazing
around the town square for another watering hole. Just across the intersection
I see a group of people on a second floor balcony engaging in mirthful revelry.
I sidle over to Roadhouse Brewing where I order myself a Highwayman pilsner, a
fitting tipple for the 8,500 miles I've stacked up on the trip. The barmaid
strikes up a conversation when she sees my Bills touque. Turns out she's from
Buffalo herself so we ruefully discuss
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/06-seattle.html?id=13-seconds"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 Seconds</a>,
and how damn good Josh Allen looks in shorts.

After our Nickel City digressions I join the bacchants on the balcony. If you
were to create the archetypical setting for a patio pilsner this would probably be it.
The sun shining through a cloudless Wyoming afternoon, the air crisp and cool.
Families are frolicking in the park in the center of town. Couples are peering
into shops before supper. A quaint vivacity exudes from the town square. An
idyllic big little town.

I slurp back my beer and head back to the rig. Up & over the pass back to Idaho
and my tiny cabin. I go for another soak before getting cleaned up for supper.
I make my way about a mile up the road to West Side Yard, a cool looking joint I
passed on the way in. When I plop down at the bar I notice a Cicerone's Choice
section. Today's selection is the Retreat Hazy IPA from Offshoot Beer Company
in Placentia, CA, a *"DIPA brewed with a simple malt bill and hopped heavily
with fruit-forward Mosaic, Cashmere, and El Dorado. Laced with delicate and
aromatic tropical notes along with a bright berry medley and a crisp mouthfeel"*.
Hot damn, I'll take one of those!

As I fill my moustache with crispy foamy froth I peruse the vittles section of
the menu. My eyes immediately fall on the wings section and it hits me that I
haven't had wings this entire trip. 2 months on the road and not a single order
of wings. By god I need to remedy that sad state of affairs.

Wings, hot. Bleu cheese. Carrots & celery. Heaven.

I have to say the wait was worth it. I don't know if it's because I have been
trapped in a wing-less desert of supply chain shortages but these wangs *slap*.
They go down all the better with my fancy ass beer. A beer so tasty I
order another just to be on the safe side. It's the perfect end to a big day on
the mountain. I polish off the wings and the brewski and make the short trek
back to the cabin to call it a night.

<h4 class="article-subheader">I'm Goin' Back to Jackson</h4>
I got a feel for the mountain now, unfortunately the mountain has a feel for
warmth. It's going to be even hotter today. Yuck.

I pack up my gear at the tiny cabin and make my way back over the pass. I'm not
as early today so I have to park in an overflow lot & take the shuttle. I waddle
up to the tram and jump aboard with 99 of my closest friends. 9 minutes and
4,139 vertical feet later I shuffle off and strap on my gear. I plan to head
back to Rendezvous Bowl but not before a quick detour.

Corbet's Couloir is the most infamous run at Jackson and has been described as
America's scariest ski slope.

I finish ogling the line and convincing myself I *could* ski it if the snow were
better (I couldn't) and riverside back to Rendezvous. It skis much the same as
it did yesterday, crusty, bumpy, but manageable. I bounce around the South side
of the hill, bopping between the Sublette Quad & Thunder Quad chairs.

Once the early afternoon rolls around the temperatures start to get uncomfortably
warm. My ass gets swampy and the snow gets soupy. Near the
bottom of the Casper Quad I duck into a run called Nex Perce, which was
undoubtedly the worst decision of the day. My first
turn I sink waist deep into the slush and endure the saddest, slowest
wipeout in the history of alpine skiing. It was like trying to walk through a
river of molasses oozing down a hill. To add to the tragedy it was directly below
a passing tram car. I gather my pride, and my skis, and set off back down the
hill. And fall three more times. Three more comically slow tumbles that would
make an outside observer question if the force of gravity had been somehow
altered.

I mercifully make it to the bottom of Nez Perce and the rest of the way home on
Lower Sundance is a nice, easy cruise. I reach the base of the mountain and
glance up at the thermometer at the tram loading station.

##### 52&deg;F

#### 52&deg;!!! WTF!

It's hotter than Joey Slowgano's break pads at Talladaga, dadgum! I wipe the
sweat off my brow and dash any inkling I may have had about going back out there.
I unclip my skis with another 22,680' under my belt and stroll over to the
Mangy Moose to cool off with a cold beer.

    <figcaption class="figure-caption" style="display:table-caption;caption-side:bottom;">Not a bad day</figcaption>
</figure>

I quickly find that I'm not the only one who decided to call it a day to cool
off. The Moose is *packed*. I eye a spot at the very far end of the bar and slide
in before someone else can snatch it. I order a Pilsgnar from trusty ol' Melvin
Brewing and strike up a conversation with the fella next to me. I'd guess he's
in his early 60's, sporting a plaid jacket and red stocking cap to accompany
his welcoming smile. "Poland" he replies when I ask where he hails from, to
which I give him a hard cheers with my pint glass.

I have yet to have a bad time drinking beer with any of my Polish brothers and
sisters and this is no exception. We exchange niceties, I learn that he's lived
in Wyoming the last 20 years, he learns that I've been on the road the last 2
months. It doesn't take long for the conversation to careen into the deep,
roiling waters of his hatred for Russia. Rightfully so. He lived through the
death throes of the Soviet Union and the chaotic aftermath of its implosion. He
wouldn't piss on Vlad Putin if he was on fire. He's fantastic.

We eventually circle back to Poland and all the places I need to visit. I
order another beer just so I can chat with him longer. I don't catch his name
as I leave the Moose but I'm going to guess it's Stanislaus. Damn fine name
Stanislaus.

I saddle up and head into town, hoping that the Million Dollar Cowboy is open
to the public today. I pull into the town square and find that I'm in luck. I
push open the swangin' doors to reveal  ____
It's like a Rainforest Cafe for adults who think *The Adventures of Davy Crockett*
was a documentary. It's equal parts preposterous and marvelous. I sidle up to
the bar and straddle the stool, which, of course, is in the form of a saddle. I
order the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar Golden Ale, because when in Rome. Assuming
Rome is Andy's toybox from Toy Story.

I enjoy my ale among a smattering of blue hairs watching the mediocre country
music act on the stage at the far end of the bar. A few saddles down, a woman
has entrenched herself at the bar. A woman who is the subject of horse prayers
every night, when horses they lay their horse heads down, thanking their horse
gods she hasn't occupied the saddle
atop their back. The metal post upon which this particular saddle resides must
be groaning below her immense heft. She's bopping around, clapping nowhere near
the beat. I can't tell if she's drunk as hell or just stupid and happy.

I polish off the suds and skedaddle out of there. I know Mike & Lizzy recommended
it to me for the sheer absurdity of it and that's whats I appreciates abouts
them. I saddle up & mosey on back over the pass headed for my tiny cabin.
Until something catches my eye. A sign. Or rather a glimpse of a sign. Just off
the side of the highway. Unless I'm seeing things I believe it said brewery
&#8680;. I blew past it at highway speeds but spun around at the gas station a
quarter mile down the road to double check my hunch. I soon find that it's true,
here lies a brewery. Well I'll be damned.

I ramble down the short drive to the brewhouse & park my rig out front. I stroll
into a smallish tasting room with a few tables and a couple barstools. I plop on
down at a barstool and order up a flight of their tasty brews. One of the guys
at the bar starts chatting & it turns out he's one of the brewers who is hanging
out for a couple pints before heading home. Dillon asks how the skiing has been
and when I tell him how shitty the conditions were he laughs and says that
doesn't make him feel so bad being cooped up in the brewery all day.

We discuss beer, skiing, traveling. When he learns that I'm headed to Utah
tomorrow he tosses out a crazy idea. Seeing as the conditions at Jackson are
proper shit, it might behoove me to check out Pine Creek Ski Area tomorrow. It's
a small, independently owned ski area about halfway to Salt Lake City. It has
30 runs and a single lift, but perhaps its most intriguing feature is the fact
that you can rent out the entire mountain mid-week. It's open to the public
Friday - Sunday then Monday - Thursday you can rent out the entire mountain for
a few thousand bucks.

I snag a 6-er of Juicy IPA for my travels and wish the fellers goodbye. It's a
short journey to the cabin where I call it an early night in this cozy abode.

<p class="section-divider my-4">&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;</p>

I wake up bright and early and load up my gear before hitting the road south
with a full tank of gas and a fresh cup of coffee. I follow the Snake River for
about an hour until the town of Alpine, home of Melvin Brewing, right on the
shores of the Palisades Reservoir. Unfortunately the brewery isn't open this
early in the morn so I continue tramping south as the Snake veers eastward,
towards its headwaters in the Tetons & Yellowstone.

Another 90 minutes of driving finds me in the town of Cokeville, WY, where I
make a left turn for the 5 mile drive through farmland and muddy roads to the
ski area. It's technically called "Pine Creek Ski Resort" but we'll
refraining from calling it a ski "resort" because a
resort it most certainly is not. But that's just how they like it. The unpaved
parking lot sits below a modest lodge beside the loading area for a single
chairlift. With 640 skiable acres and
1,450' of vertical this little operation services a decent amount of terrain.
I cross my fingers that the light flurries we're getting today keep up.

I strap on my gear and purchase a reasonably priced lift ticket from the
ticket sales/ski
rental/ski shop/guest services all-in-one counter. Besides a couple other carloads
the only other visitors at the mountain today are a class of middle-school aged
kids who arrived here on a schoolbus. I'm not sure if they are on early
Spring Break or they can skip out on school on Fridays in the winter but either
way I'm super jealous. Half are mulling about the lodge and the other half are
in varying states of alpine athletics. I'd say at most there are 40 people here
today but it's probably closer to 30. That's over 20 acres for the each of us!

I strap on the planks & hit the chair, which I guess is just called THE chair
since it's the only one out here. *I've been through the desert on a chair with
no name*. The ride up is surprisingly long - a 12 minute jaunt at 3.8 miles per
hour, a leisurely stroll compared to the 16 mph of the Jackson tram or 10 mph of
the high speed quads. But despite the unhurried pace of the lift it's quite
peaceful. Just you, your thoughts, and the serenity of a rural Wyoming mountain.
At the top there's an older fella in the lift operator hut with a
reddish-white bushy beard and a friendly smile. I give him a wave and he returns
the favor with a warmth & friendliness that makes you feel welcome at Pine Creek.

Off the lift I head over to skiers right because I've got nothing better to do
and find myself on a carpet of snow rolled out between the rocks. It's not
great and an inauspicious start to the day. Things improve on the next run,
however, when I stay a little closer to the lift & find some good snow. The
next few runs I stay in this area, dipping into some glades that have held the
snow shockingly well. In general, the snow coverage is pretty poor, but in this
section of the mountain the conditions are better than most places I've skied
on this trip. Granted, that's a low bar, but a bar nonetheless.

On the drive in from I got a call from my good buddy Landon about the birth of
his first child. In the course of the congratulations and transcendental musings
of fatherhood he asked if I've
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/04-bend.html?id=rain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gotten rained on again</a>.
I laughed & told him no, confident that my days of rain skiing were behind me.
Well obviously the skiing gods were listening and took little time to punish me
for my hubris. On my 7th run the flurries turn to rain, my mood from cheery to
sour.
