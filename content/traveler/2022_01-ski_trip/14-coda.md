I remember where I was when I hatched this ludicrous plan. I was sitting at the
counter of my aunt & uncle's house in Victor, NY when I thought about the best
way to maximize my ski pass


As my cousin Joanne said when I was overstaying my welcome in Seattle, "said you
have health, time, & money and rarely do you have all three."

My distant cousin Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote, “do not go where the path may
lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.”

Well, Ralph, I think I made myself a nice little trail.
