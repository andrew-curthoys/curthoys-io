23,000' of vert, bringing my total just over 600k. My total skiing distance
is 560 miles.


Try Orlando's New Mexican Cafe fish tacos rec from Phil, closed on Mondays

<h4 class="article-subheader">Well Now What</h4>
I pull out of Taos and things immediately go awry. I pull up to Orlando's only to
find they are closed on Mondays. "What rotten luck," exclaims the gentleman who
just spent the past 2.5 months skiing. I scoot through town and make a quick
stop to stroll around Taos Plaza. I'm pleased to see the Hotel La Fonda still
welcoming travelers through her open doors. I'm less than pleased to find that
Ogelvie's, a New Mexican grill & cantina that provided sustenance on many a ski
trip, has shut its doors. I was kinda hankerin' for a margarita from Ogie's
since this is the first time I've been to Taos of age. I reckon this town just
ain't fer a city slicker like me.

I hit the dusty trail and mosey into Santa Fe just after dark. I check me & the
steed in to El Sendero Inn, a
run-of-the-mill motor hotel that would come standard in your Post-War Americana
starter kit. To my delight the rooms appear to have been renovated in the past
few years, with little to no wear-and-tear, shockingly clean carpet, actually
comfortable beds, and sleek, modern appliances. Google is besmirching the good
name of the Sendero by calling it a "1-star hotel."

While preparing for supper I realize that Orlando's and Ogelvie's are just the
opening salvos in an onslaught of ski-trip-denouement misfortunes. As I open my
Dopp kit I notice everything is perplexingly coated with an an oily film. I
retrieve my toiletries from the satchel to discover the culprit. My tincture of
beard oil has opened in transit and deposited its slippery contents upon
everything inside.

After cleansing oily residue off my washroom amenities then myself I make the
short walk to Hotel La
Fonda on the Plaza* for what I hope is a dynamite serving of New Mexican
enchiladas. My first night of this trip I enjoyed enchiladas in Las Cruces, New
Mexico, it feels poetic to bookend the trip with New Mexican enchiladas.

*La Fonda translates to "the inn" in Spanish, this La Fonda has no relation to
the La Fonda in Taos nor the likely myriad La Fondas scattered 'round the Land
of Enchantment.

New Mexican enchiladas possess two main qualities that differentiate them from
other families of of enchilada. The first is a general proclivity of New Mexican
cuisine, which is their use of green chiles. Most places when you order salsa
it's red. Because that's the color of salsa right? Not in New Mexico. It's such
a point of pride that residents of the great state of New Mexico have the option
of brandishing a license plate upon their vehicle with green chiles. My favorite
variant on the green chile/red chile dichotomy is "Christmas style" - half
green/half red. Because that just seems like more fun.

The second emphasis of New Mexican enchiladas is explicitly related to
enchiladas, and based on the strong feelings a disconcertingly large proportion
of the population hold about tropical fruits on pizza, likely to be controversial.
Instead of rolling the enchiladas in a tortilla sleeping bag, enchiladas in New
Mexico are laid flat and stacked like an order of flapjacks with the filling
in between the tortilla scaffolding.

About halfway through my libation the enchiladas arrive and I immediately
notice something is wrong. I look up to the unsuspecting waitress,

"They're not flat."

"Oh I'm sorry, did you want them flat?"

"I thought that's how y'all did it in New Mexico?"

"Well typically it is, but we get so many tourists that come in here and throw
a fit that we started rolling them. Do you want me to have them
re-do it?"

"Oh no, this is totally fine, I just had my heart set on some authentic New
Mexican enchiladas"

"Are you sure you don't want me to send them back?"

"No these look great. Thank you so much."

So I dig into some lame ass rolled up enchiladas. Hopefully Kramer's Dominicans
aren't back there rolling them, ain't nobody got time to get scalded by
enchiladas rolled too damn tight.

Thinking back over this interaction I've determined that I need to start working
"That won't be necessary" into my lexicon. Have a look:

"They're not flat"

"Oh I'm sorry, did you want them flat?"

*Don Draper glare-squint* "That won't be necessary."

Way cooler.

After supper I saunter over to the bar for end of trip celebratory nightcap. I
plop myself down at a plush barstool with thoughts of a Rye Old Fashioned
dancing through my head. Over the course of the next 5 minutes the bartender
walks past me a half dozen times without so much as acknowledging my presence.
Now I'm not one to offhandedly besmirch a keeper of the bar. They are busy
people. They have a tough job. I appreciate bartenders with every corpuscle of
my being.

But this bar is not busy. There's a group of 3 people at one corner of the bar
then me. I'm not necessarily in a hurry but it's kinda part of the job to at
least toss down a napkin and say "hey boss what'll it be for ya?" I have
enough time to pull out my phone and search other bars in the area that would
more appropriately quench my thirst. This place is too snooty anyways.

I drop my phone into my pocket, slide my barstool out behind me, and promptly
bash my head into a rack of wine glasses overhanging the bar. I'm fine but there
are a couple wine glasses who are worse for wear. Now I gotta say, brother if
you want to get a bartender's attention bash your head into a rack of wine
glasses because I HAD his attention.

Which iss a double edged sword. I've gotten his attention but I had my heart
set on another bar. After helping him & a colleague clean up the mess I made
the barkeep throws down a napkin in front of me & says "hey boss what'll it be
for ya?"

"Rye Old Fashioned"

"You got it"

And before I finish checking for glass shards on my barstool he returns with an
$18 Rye Old Fashioned. Wait. There's no possible way you whipped up an Old
Fashioned that fast. Do you have these things pre-mixed? And you expect
me to pay 18 USD for it?

I take one sip and almost spit it back across the bar. It tastes like someone
poured a dram of Jim Beam in a melted snow cone. I can only interpret today's
travails as a sign that this ski trip shouldn't come to an end. I choke down
the unholy concoction and make for the El Sendero, I think Santa Fe is trying to
kick me the hell out and I ain't too bold to question her.

My last stop as I leave town is Ohori's Coffee, which is one of my favorite
coffee shops I've ever patronized. Did it used to be something else????
The large windows allow the first rays of the morning to caress the adobe walls
and glint off the
stainless steel apparati of the espresso machine. The high ceilings give the
feel of a space that's much larger than a coffee shop should be. The Southwestern
vibe is accentuated by Talin Market right next door, specializing in world
cuisines and native staples.



I roll into Tulsa just after dark on the 22nd day of March, exactly 76 days
after I departed.

1 outrageous adventure

I remember where I was when I hatched this ludicrous plan. I was sitting at the
counter of my aunt & uncle's house in Victor, NY. There wasn't anything in
particular that spurred it on, I think I just wanted to see how many ski resorts
I could hit on my pass.

Some kids backpack through Europe. Some kids take a gap year. I went to school,
worked the 9-to-5, took my 3 weeks of vacation. I did it because it was what
you were supposed to do. I hadn't red Kerouac. I have since. I hadn't read
Ginsberg. I plan to. It wasn't some sort of wanderlust that hit me. It wasn't

It was me becoming more comfortable in my own skin, confident to venture out
into the unknown. To chart my own course. To ask why not. To catch a case of
the fuckits.

I know it's cliche. I know that library shelves sag heavy with stories of travel,
with stories of self realization, with stories of privileged white dudes. I can
write all I
want about not "taking it for granted" that I was able to take this incredible
trip but I do. There's no other way you would make such a ludicrous trip if you
didn't take it for granted.

This is all a bunch of cliches but to me


As my cousin Joanne said when I was overstaying my welcome in Seattle, "said you
have health, time, & money and rarely do you have all three."

I'll leave it to my distant cousin Ralph Waldo Emerson said it better than I
ever could,
