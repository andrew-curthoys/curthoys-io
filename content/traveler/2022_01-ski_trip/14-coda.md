is 560 miles.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Santa Fe</h4>
I pull into Santa Fe after dark and check in to El Sendero Inn, a
run-of-the-mill motor hotel that would come standard in your Post-War Americana
starter kit. To my delight the rooms appear to have been renovated in the past
few years, with little to no wear-and-tear, shockingly clean carpet, actually
comfortable beds, and sleek, modern appliances. Google is besmirching the good
name of the Sendero by calling it a "1-star hotel."

* Were there any Olympic events on today? I thought I watched some snowboarding or women's skiing

My short stay in Santa Fe did not start off on the right foot. As I open my Dopp
kit I notice everything is perplexingly coated with an an oily film. I pull
everything out and stack it on the sink when I find the culprit. My tincture of
beard oil has opened in transit and deposited its contents upon everything in
the toiletry bag with a slippery residue.

After cleaning up my amenities then myself I make the short walk to Hotel La
Fonda on the Plaza for what I hope is a dynamite serving of New Mexican
enchiladas. My first night of this trip I enjoyed enchiladas in Las Cruces, New
Mexico, it feels poetic to bookend the trip with New Mexican enchiladas.

New Mexican enchiladas possess two main qualities that differentiate them from
other families of of enchilada. The first is a general proclivity of New Mexican
cuisine, which is their use of green chiles. Most places when you order salsa
it's red. Because that's the color of salsa right? Not in New Mexico. It's such
a point of pride that residents of the great state of New Mexico have the option
of brandishing a license plate upon their vehicle with green chiles. My favorite
variant on the green chile/red chile dichotomy is "Christmas style" - half
green/half red. Because that just seems like more fun.

The second emphasis of New Mexican enchiladas is explicitly related to
enchiladas, and based on the strong feelings a disconcertingly large proportion
of the population hold about tropical fruits on pizza, likely to be controversial.
Instead of rolling the enchiladas in a tortilla sleeping bag, enchiladas in New
Mexico are laid flat and stacked like an order of flapjacks with the filling
in between the tortilla scaffolding.

About halfway through my libation the enchiladas arrive and I immediately
notice something is wrong. I look up to the unsuspecting waitress,

"They're not flat."

"Oh I'm sorry, did you want them flat?"

"I thought that's how y'all did it in New Mexico?"

"Well typically it is, but we get so many tourists that come in here and throw
a fit that we started rolling them. Do you want me to have them
re-do it?"

"Oh no, this is totally fine, I just had my heart set on some authentic New
Mexican enchiladas"

"Are you sure you don't want me to send them back?"

"No these look great. Thank you so much."

So I dig into some lame ass rolled up enchiladas. Hopefully Kramer's Dominicans
aren't back there rolling them, ain't nobody got time to get scalded by
enchiladas rolled too damn tight.

Thinking back over this interaction I've determined that I need to start working
"That won't be necessary" into my lexicon. Have a look:

"They're not flat"

"Oh I'm sorry, did you want them flat?"

*Don Draper glare-squint* "That won't be necessary."

Way cooler.


My last stop as I leave town is Ohori's Coffee, which is one of my favorite
coffee shops I've ever patronized. Did it used to be something else????
The large windows allow the first rays of the morning to caress the adobe walls
and glint off the
stainless steel apparati of the espresso machine. The high ceilings give the
feel of a space that's much larger than a coffee shop should be. The Southwestern
vibe is accentuated by Talin Market right next door, specializing in world
cuisines and native staples.



As I leave Santa Fe I take a peek at the trip odometer. 10,450.9 miles. What a
long strange trip it's been.

I remember where I was when I hatched this ludicrous plan. I was sitting at the
counter of my aunt & uncle's house in Victor, NY when I thought about the best
way to maximize my ski pass


As my cousin Joanne said when I was overstaying my welcome in Seattle, "said you
have health, time, & money and rarely do you have all three."

I'll leave it to my distant cousin Ralph Waldo Emerson said it better than I
ever could,
