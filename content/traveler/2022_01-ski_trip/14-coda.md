summary: I check my SkiTracks and I finish my last day of the trip with a hard-earned 23k vertical bringing my total for the season just over 600,000 vertical feet.  That's probably more than I've skied in my entire life. The 580 miles I put under my Volkls could get me all the way back from Taos to Tulsa. If only it were that easy.

I check my SkiTracks and I finish the last day of the trip with a hard-earned
23k vertical bringing my total for the season just over 600,000 vertical feet.
That's probably more than I've skied in my entire life. The 580 miles I put
under my Volkls could get me all the way back from Taos to Tulsa. If only it
were that easy.

I pull out of Taos and things immediately go awry. As I trot the ol' gal up to
the swangin' doors of Orlando's with a rumbling belly I'm awful sore to
find they are closed on Mondays. "What rotten luck," exclaims the feller who
just spent the past 2.5 months skiing.

</figure>

I continue the trot on down the trail to town for a quick saunterin'
'round Taos Plaza. Overlooking the Plaza the Hotel La Fonda continues to welcome
guests 'neath her adobe ______. Ain't that a daisy. But then I 'bout pitch a
fit when I discover that Ogelvie's, a New Mexican grill & cantina that provided
sustenance on many a ski
trip, has shut its doors. I was kinda hankerin' for a margarita from Ogie's,
seein' as this is the first time I've been to Taos of age. I reckon this town
just ain't fer a city slicker like me.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Well at least the Fonda's still goin' strong</figcaption>
</figure>

I git back on the trail and mosey into Santa Fe just before dark. I check into
the El Sendero Inn and tie the steed up at a waterin' trough. El Sendero is a
run-of-the-mill motor hotel, the type that would come standard in your Post-War
Americana starter kit. Seein's as I's is a city slicker, 
I'm pleased to discover that the rooms appear to have been recently renovated,
with little to no wear-and-tear, surprisingly clean carpet, shockingly
comfortable beds, and sleek, modern appliances. Google classifies the Sendero as
a "1-star hotel," which is outright slander and grounds for a duel.

While preparing for supper I realize that Orlando's and Ogelvie's are just the
opening salvos in an onslaught of ski-trip-denouement misfortunes. I open my
Dopp kit only to discover that the contents within are perplexingly coated with
an oily film. I pull out the items one-by-one until I discover the culprit - my
tincture of beard oil has opened in transit and deposited its slippery payload
upon all its mates.

After cleansing oily residue off my washroom amenities then myself I make the
short walk to Hotel La
Fonda on the Plaza* for what I hope is a dynamite serving of New Mexican
enchiladas. My first night of this trip I enjoyed enchiladas in Las Cruces, New
Mexico, it feels poetic to bookend the trip with New Mexican enchiladas.

*La Fonda translates to "the inn" in Spanish, this La Fonda has no relation to
the La Fonda in Taos nor the likely myriad La Fondas scattered 'round the Land
of Enchantment.

New Mexican enchiladas possess two main qualities that differentiate them from
other families of of enchilada. The first is a general proclivity of New Mexican
cuisine, which is their use of green chiles. Most places when you order salsa
it's red. Because that's the color of salsa right? Not in New Mexico. It's such
a point of pride that residents of the great state of New Mexico have the option
of brandishing a license plate upon their vehicle with green chiles. My favorite
variant on the green chile/red chile dichotomy is "Christmas style" - half
green/half red. Because that just seems like more fun.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">One of the best plates in the Union</figcaption>
</figure>

The second emphasis of New Mexican enchiladas is explicitly related to
enchiladas, and based on the strong feelings a disconcertingly large proportion
of the population hold about tropical fruits on pizza, likely to be controversial.
Instead of rolling the enchiladas in a tortilla sleeping bag, enchiladas in New
Mexico are laid flat and stacked like an order of flapjacks with the filling
in between the tortilla scaffolding.

About halfway through my libation the enchiladas arrive and I immediately
notice something is wrong. I look up to the unsuspecting waitress,

"They're not flat."

"Oh I'm sorry, did you want them flat?"

"I thought that's how y'all did it in New Mexico?"

"Well typically it is, but we get so many tourists that come in here and throw
a fit that we started rolling them. Do you want me to have them
re-do it?"

"Oh no, this is totally fine, I just had my heart set on some authentic New
Mexican enchiladas"

"Are you sure you don't want me to send them back?"

"No these look great. Thank you so much."

So I dig into some lame ass rolled up enchiladas. Hopefully Kramer's Dominicans
have the night off.

</figure>

Thinking back over this interaction I've determined that I need to start working
"That won't be necessary" into my lexicon. Have a look:

"They're not flat"

"Oh I'm sorry, did you want them flat?"

*Don Draper glare-squint* "That won't be necessary."

Way cooler.

After supper I mosey over to the bar for end of trip celebratory nightcap. I
plop down at a plush barstool with a thirst for a Rye Old Fashioned to warsh'n
the trail dust off me gullet. Over the course of the next 5 minutes the bartender
walks past me a half dozen times without so much as acknowledging my presence.
Now I'm not one to offhandedly besmirch a keeper of the bar. They are busy
people. They have a tough job. I appreciate bartenders with every corpuscle of
my being.

But this bar is not busy. There's me and a group of 3 people at the other corner
of the bar. I'm not necessarily in a hurry but it's kinda part of the job to at
least toss down a napkin and say "hey boss what'll it be for ya?" I have
enough time to pull out my phone and search other bars in the area that would
more appropriately quench my thirst. This place is too snooty anyways.

I drop my phone into my pocket, slide my barstool out behind me, and enthusiastically
bash my head into a rack of wine glasses overhanging the bar. My thick skull
endures the episode unscathed but it leaves a few
wine glasses that are worse for wear. Now I gotta say brother, if
you want to get a bartender's attention, just bash your head into a rack of wine
glasses. Because I HAD his attention.

Which is a double edged sword. I've gotten his attention but I no longer wish
to tipple at this establishment. A mighty awkward pickle I find myself in.
After helping clean up my mess the barkeep throws down a napkin & says "hey boss
what'll it be for ya?" Damn you Santa Fe.

"Rye Old Fashioned"

"You got it"

And before I finish checking for glass shards on my barstool he returns with an
$18 Rye Old Fashioned. Wait. There's no possible way you whipped up an Old
Fashioned that fast. Do you have these things pre-mixed? And you expect
me to pay 18 USD for it? Damn you again Santa Fe.

I take one sip and almost spit it back across the bar. It tastes like someone
poured a dram of Jim Beam in a melted snow cone. I can only interpret today's
travails as a sign that this ski trip shouldn't come to an end. I choke down
the unholy concoction and swiftly make for the El Sendero, I think this town is
trying to forcibly disgorge me and I ain't too bold to question her.

<p class="section-divider my-4">&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;</p>

The next morning she totally redeems herself with Ohori's Coffee, a truly
fabulous coffee shop. The large windows and high ceilings ___________ the
feel of a space that's much larger than a coffee shop should be. The Southwestern
vibe is accentuated by Talin Market right next door, specializing in world
cuisines and native staples.

I order myself a jet black coffee as large as their legal representation will
allow in good faith and hit the road headed East. A journey of 640 miles of
Interstate highway all that's separating me from a night in my own bed.

10 hours later I roll into Tulsa just after dark on the 22nd day of March,
exactly 76 days after I departed.

What a long strange trip it's been.

I remember where I was when I hatched this ludicrous plan. I was sitting at the
counter of my aunt & uncle's house in Victor, NY. There wasn't anything in
particular that spurred it on, I think I just wanted to see how many ski resorts
I could hit on my pass.

Some kids backpack through Europe. Some kids take a gap year. I went to school,
worked the 9-to-5, took my 3 weeks of vacation. I did it because it was what
you were supposed to do. I hadn't red Kerouac. I have since. I hadn't read
Ginsberg. I plan to. It wasn't some sort of wanderlust that hit me. It wasn't

It was me becoming more comfortable in my own skin, confident to venture out
into the unknown. To chart my own course. To ask why not. To catch a case of
the fuckits.

I know it's cliche. I know that library shelves sag heavy with stories of travel,
with stories of self realization, with stories of privileged white dudes. I can
write all I
want about not "taking it for granted" that I was able to take this incredible
trip but I do. There's no other way you would make such a ludicrous trip if you
didn't take it for granted.

It's cliche, but it's my cliche. And this is my website so lay off!!
But seriously what are you still doing here? Have I not bored you yet?

Well... since you've made it this far, I'll let my distant cousin Ralph Waldo
Emerson have the last word, since he said it better than I ever could:

<div class="mx-3 fs-5 fst-italic text-muted">“Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.”</div>
