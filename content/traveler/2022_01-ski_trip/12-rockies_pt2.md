<h4 class="article-subheader">Ohhhhh Shit</h4>
I reach into my pocket and....

Nothing.

Nothing but an empty jacket pocket. Well to be more precise a jacket pocket
filled with lint and air. But most certainly not filled with a phone.

A phone that was playing some rockin' tunes.

A phone that I'm relying on for my directions home.

A phone that you take for granted until it's gone.

Maybe I got crazy and put it in another pocket? I frantically pat myself down
like I'm doing the Macarena at a minor league baseball game in 1997.

And a sinking realization sets in that I've probably lost it forever. Doomed to
a snow covered grave on the Montezuma Bowl at Arapahoe basin.

I'm currently riding the Zuma Chair, where my predicament began a half hour ago.
I was waiting to board when the tight three-part harmonies of
an Americana string band surfing atop the rollicking waves of a twangy groove
tickled my eardrum. I look to the liftie whose
speakers were guilty of the auditive allurement,

"Damn, these guys kick ass, who are they?"

"The Last Revel, my buddy just turned me on to them."

"Hell yeah! I'm gonna turn 'em on right now. Thanks boss."

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/17bRvTnijKoadjX2ZGNibY?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="380" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

And so I do.

Well at least I attempt to. The lower regions of the Montezuma
Bowl are cellularly challenged so the jam sesh is postponed till the upper
reaches of the bowl. At the top of the lift I dart left for about a hundred
yards with my new favorite band rocking in my ears. I click out of my skis for
my third & final hike
up to the Zuma Cornice. It's not an especially grueling hike, but with the
12,000'+ elevation and unsure footing it requires a deceptively high level of
exertion.

It's totally worth it though, because the skiing is incredible. The terrain is
challenging yet approachable, a wide-open bowl above the treeline with a
melange of chutes ideal for sending. Perplexingly, the bowl is nearly devoid of
other alpine athletes - I have to
imagine the hike and intimidating heft of the massive crag brooding over the
chair deter most skiers.

Having said that I've reached the point of the day where the marginal cost of
rising lactic acid levels have begun to outweigh the marginal benefit of powder
chutes. Last hike of the day, let's let 'er rip whaddya say?

I, indeed, let 'er rip, swooping smooth arcs through the fresh Colorado snow.
I've developed an admirable alpine acumen after 30 days of skiing this season,
more than thrice my previous PR.
Somewhere in the middle of all those turns I hit the point of no cell reception
and my headphones go dark.

Or at least I thought I hit the point of no cell reception.

I now realize it was actually my phone flying out of my pocket as
I was flying down the hill. If the liftie had been
playing Nickelback I wouldn't be in this position. I blame his good taste in
music, not my boneheaded carelessness.

With the depth of the snow on the mountain my phone is almost surely buried
under two feet of pillowy powder. However, I have a couple leads
that give me a puncher's chance of finding it. First, I have a general idea on
the mountain where the music cut out. Second, I have my
headphones that should connect to the phone once I'm within a certain distance.
Unfortunately, due to point #1, I'll have to make the hike again. Woof.

So I have a battle plan - retrace my steps and fire up the headphones every so
often to see if they'll connect. Hell, it's worth a shot.

I slide off the lift and lethargically mope up the hiking trail once more,
cursing myself for being so careless with my pocket zipper. Eventually
I find myself atop the Groswold chute and throw a Hail Mary, turning
on the headphones to see if it's right up here at the top. No luck.

I make a few turns down from the top & try again. Nothing.

A few more turns. No sir.

*swoosh swoosh swoosh*

Nada

*swoosh swoosh swoosh*

Zilch

*swoosh swoosh swoosh*

Nothin' doin'

*swoosh swoosh swoosh*

Noooooooope.

Ok you get the picture. I do this most of the way down the top section of the
mountain. That is until I reach the bottom of the chute, when after turning on
the headphones I hear an angelic robotic voice

<code>--Boop-- <i>Connected to Tiny Andy Dufresne.</i></code>\*

\*Don't ask my why I named my phone Tiny Andy Dufresne\*\*

\*\*Don't ask because I have no idea why.

Connected! That's a Bingo!!!!

Head on a swivel. Searching. Scanning. And then I see it! About 20 yards down the
hill, sitting on top of the snow flat as a pancake. Unbelievable.
I've mentioned it multiple times on this trip but I have no idea what I did to
deserve the ridiculous luck I've been afforded on my adventure but I'm not going
to question it. I'm just going to trust the process.

I slide right up to my phone, dust off the snow, and turn back on The Last
Revel. Hell yeah.

I'm blasting tunes, I'm ripping turns, I'm feeling vibes.

But most importantly, now I won't get lost.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Where the Hell Am I?</h4>
I'm lost.

I thought I was headed for the Four Points Lodge for lunch and a mid-day
brewski. So why in the world am I at the bottom of the Pony Express lift?

Whereas Arapahoe Basin was the last stop on my Colorado sojourn, my current
confines of Steamboat Springs is the first. Over the years I've heard myriad
tales of Steamboat's "champagne powder," a snow so dry, light, and fluffy that
powder hounds come from far & wide to worship during their yearly pilgrimage.
So while it's been on my radar the past few years, it's mostly been aspirational
due to it's geographical isolation and distance from Denver - about twice as far
as the well-trod path of Breckenridge/Vail/Keystone/etc. But it fits perfectly
into my itinerary this trip - it's right on the way from SLC. So I left Bob &
LaGayle's early in the morning & rolled into Steamboat around lunchtime.
Beautiful country.

As someone who takes pride in my bearing-keeping today has been a humbling
experience. I've been lost all. damn. day. How I got to the Pony Express chair
I have no idea. What I do know is that I'm on chair
\#35 so I'm obligated to shoot my good friend Frank Dale a photo since everybody
knows that was his number when he played boundary corner for the Cascia Hall
Commandos.

</figure>

My geographical confusion is confounded, at least in part, by the layout of the
resort. Not content with a single peak or even a couple, Steamboat Ski Resort
comprises 6 separate named peaks in a layout that'll make your internal compass
spin. All runs emanate from a narrow runway adjacent to the base area, with
two beginner lifts and the Steamboat Gondola providing conveyance to all points
beyond. The 9 minute ride up the gondola
drops you atop Thunderhead Peak, where the real fun begins. Behind Thunderhead
lies a sea of peaks, valleys, and saddles that all seem to surround each other
in a diabolical whirlpool of metamorphic schist. I have the utmost respect and
admiration for legendary ski map trail painter
<a href="https://jamesniehues.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James Niehues</a>,
but even his map is unable to accurately portray the labyrinthine layout of
Steamboat. It's a ski resort fit for M.C. Escher.

So I'm on the Pony Express lift, but I really want to be at the lodge drinking
a beer. On my way up the cableway I devour Mr Niehues's trail map like I'm
studying for the bar exam. *May it
Please the Court:* I plan to take Longhorn down to the Wapiti cutover, which
should dump me right at the base of the Bar-UE chair. From there it's a quick
ride up & easy scoot down to Four Points and an ice cold bowl of loudmouth soup.
Sounds easy enough.

Off the chair I veer right, headed for Longhorn. About halfway down I
dive into the short piste of Wapiti aaaaaaaaand there's no chair. I look up to
my left and the two seater is spinning about 200 yards up a side hill above a
copse of trees. You've GOT to be kidding me!!

My only option now is to ski the cat track all the way around the the side of
the mountain to the main base area. I dawdle over there & hop on the gondola,
which takes me to the Thunderhead Lodge and I am finally matched with my ever
illusory pint of suds. I enjoy the beer on the patio with blue skies & warm sun.

I still have a few more hours of daylight left so I suck down the beer and get
back out there. I head over to the backside for a couple runs on the Morningside
area. The top of the bowl is nice but it flattens out pretty quick and the
juice just ain't worth the squeeze. But I'll have a a chance to check out the
Christmas Tree Bowl on my way back down the frontside, a run that was recommended
by a local on the chair.

At the top of Morningside I shoot over the ridge into Xmas Tree. I quickly find
out that this run just ain't for me. A steep descent through a dense thicket of
robust conifers and rutty snow piled high in crusty mounds. I'm not in the
mood to Sonny Bono myself so I scoot out to skier's left of the bowl towards
The Chutes. These are some of the steepest runs on the mountain but lack the
trees that deterred me from the bowl.

As I pull up to the chutes I find a group
of high school/college aged kids gathering their nerves to take the plunge.
After 5 minutes of will-they-won't-they most of the group chickens out & rides
the ridge around to skier's left. Two brave souls muster the courage to petition
the Gods of Send for safe passage before throwing themselves over the cornice.
They both successfully navigate the chute and exchange enthusiastic high-5s
at the bottom. I sidle up to the lip of the chute and drop in to skier's right.
The top of the chute is the most challenging section, which I deftly navigate
(arguable) with a few jump turns then send it through the bottom section. I
let out a quick WOOOO to my chute buddies as I pass them headed for the more
moderate slopes of Storm Peak.

By this point the rays of our noble star have become rather
oblique, signaling the end of the day is nigh. I take another couple laps off
Storm Peak Express before heading back down to the narrow
landing chute at the base area.

I pack up my gear in the lot and head into Steamboat proper, a nice little
Colorado mountain town straddling a bubbling stream. A bubbling stream, sure
but certainly nothing a steamboat could navigate. Wait a second, what's
all this Steamboat business about?

I decide to investigate atop a barstool at the Barley Tap and Tavern right on
the main drag. According to the tale, early 19th century trappers in the area
heard a chugging sound and incorrectly presumed that a steamboat was rollicking
down a nearby river. However, when they correctly diagnosed the cause of
the auditory emissions, they discovered that it was coming from a hot spring,
which they named Steamboat Spring.

Yawn.

When the bartender comes 'round I order myself a flight that will hopefully add
some excitement to my day after that boring story. It was a fairly typical
flight situation - I
write down the barley sammiches I'd like to try out and the fella brings em
to me. Well, partner, during the interim period between scribbling my selections
and the barkeep fulfilling those selections this ol boy plops down in the stool
next to me who seemingly started with a whiskey in his coffee this morning and
hasn't looked back.

So when the bartender brought back my mini wooden ski of small offerings of
delightful ale this dude lost his damn mind. Not only is he shithouse drunk he
apparently has never seen a flight of beer before, the combination of which seems
impossible.

"Whoaaa dude.. what's that??"

"Huh?"

"What did you get? How many beers is that? I didn't even know you could do that!!??"

"Uhh yeah it's a flight, you've never gotten a flight before?"

- I should mention here that this man appears to have aged to a ripe mid-30s, an
age where you'd expect someone to have at the very least *seen* a flight of beer.
If he was 22 I'd give him a pass but come on.

"Naw man, I normally only get Coors"

"Oh well they definitely don't have that here, what the hell are you doing in a
craft brewery then?"

"Well it started snowin' outside and it said beer on the sign so I just dove in
here"

I really can't fault him there.

"So what do you do, just tell them you want 4 beers and they bring them to you
or what?"

"Yeah," I deadpan as I look outside to see champagne powder piling up on the
sidewalks. I pull out my phone to
check for lodging options seeing as the Uncle Andy Inn will be quite
uncomfortable in this weather. It seems I'm the last person within 200 miles to
get the weather report because every hotel, airbnb, campsite, & RV park in town
is fully booked up for the night. The closest thing I can find is the
Travelodge in Yampa, about 30 miles south of town.

I do my best to ignore the drunkard next to me and he mercifully (for me) begins
to badger the bartender. As I sip my suds the snow really begins to fly. I
better scoot. I throw back the last of the beers, wish my new friend the best of
luck on... whatever the hell he's got going on... and point my rig due south.
Luckily the only place
the roads get a little squirrely is the pass around Thorpe Mountain, but even
there it ain't terrible. Nothin' the ol' trusty Pathfinder can't handle.

I arrive at the Travelodge under the cover of darkness. I bundle up and trundle
over to the inn where I see a sign so preposterous I belt out a belly laugh so
loud and spontaneous that it surprises even me.

I have to say that registering at a diner is an altogether new experience for
me. I've stayed in some shithole lodgings before but never one where you have to
check in at a *diner*. It's like something out of a Taylor Sheridan movie.

I'm fully expecting to see an old woman perched behind the counter, chewin' the
fat over the sound of some unrecognizable
animal tissue sizzling on the griddle, the stale smell of rancid grease, and the
perplexing phenomenon that you can only find in a diner where every surface is
equally sticky and slippery at the same time.

I was not disappointed.

An exciting experience to say the least. I wander over to Penny's Diner to
see exactly what you'd expect to see at a small town diner at 9 PM on a
Sunday.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">What else could you expect from a small
  town diner at 9 PM on a Sunday.</figcaption>
</figure>

Candy, after finishing her thought to the gentleman at the counter.. Then
another.. And another... Exasperatedly shuffles my way.

"Checkin' in?"

"Uhh yeah"

"Credit card & license"

I hand over the required documents and Candy begins a charade where she has to
say out loud every step of the process like it's her first time doing it
without the manager standing over her shoulder. Mind you, the Travelodge is 3
stories tall with what I'd guess are around 20 rooms per floor, she must have
done this *dozens* of times today.

Of course there's the obligatory, "These damn computers, I can never figure
them out"

Candy's sanctuary is the 3' alley between Penny's griddle and Penny's counter.
There she feels at home. There she feels safe. There the world makes sense. Once
she steps foot outside the comfortable confines of the griddle the demons return.
The office a dungeon of Promethian misery. The computer a demonic gargoyle that
slowly sucks her life force with every click of its tail and tap of its scales.
The hotel a bottomless chasm of pure evil that exists solely to strip Candy of
her joy.

"Here's your key, you're in room 312. Take a right outside
these doors and your keycard will get you into the building. The elevator will
be on your left, take it to the third floor and your room will be halfway down
the hall on your right."

"Thank you Candy."

And Candy dies just a little more inside.

<p class="section-divider my-4">&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;</p>

Penny's Diner is rated a 3.5 stars out of 5 on Tripadvisor. This mediocre rating
slots them in as the \#2 restaurant in Yampa, Colorado.

Out of 2.

One particularly entertaining review of Penny's Diner of dubious helpfulness is
simply entitled *Customer Service*. The
opening line of this screed is a true literary gem: "Me and my family came here
after putting our dog to sleep, we mainly just wanted milkshakes."

Brilliance.

I walk into Penny's the next morning 

After brekky I head back to Steamboat for another half day on the hill before
the drive to Denver. It's a lot more of the same, getting lost, checking the map,
getting lost..er, asking someone for directions, going up so I can go down,
going down so I can go up. So I don't even have the benefit
of the champagne pow while I'm aimlessly tracing a path of Brownian motion.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Left at the Next Light!</h4>
I holler in my duties as the de facto navigator of this roving band of walking
miscreants. It's St. Paddy's Day and I'm on my way to the Fainting Goat Irish
Pub with a new group of friends I just met at today at my hostel in the Capitol
Hill neighborhood of Denver. I've been appointed the group's leader since I
bellied up to the same bar earlier this afternoon while my bed was readied at
the hostel.

While bellied up to the bar I heard one inebriated fella tell nobody and
everybody at the bar all at once, "I LOVE Prague! The thing about Prague is that
so many historical buildings survived the war because Hitler wanted to move his
headquarters there after the war!"

Which of course led me to a 5-star Tripadvisor review of Prague by a middle
aged Canadian woman simply entitled *"Prague--A City so Beautiful it was Spared
by Hitler"*

She goes on, in her own translation of Kampf 3:16,
<div class="mx-3 mb-3"><i>
Hilter so loved Prague, he wanted to save it for himself. When I heard this little-known fact, I just had to see it.
<br><br>
It is incredible to think the black heart of an evil dictator holds space for such reflection, Is it possible in some still moment he allowed the city's mysterious beauty to pause his disdain for humanity?
</i></div>

Later on in her review she writes whimsically,
<div class="mx-3 mb-3"><i>
Nothing compared to the experience of shopping the red-roofed Christmas markets
with scents of fresh baked goods, sausages and hot mulled wine wafting by your
nose. Christmas carols playing gently in the squares and every front door home
to a small Christmas tree adorned in oranges, lemons, cinnamon and bows.
</i></div>

Before I'm fully sucked into the delusionary scribblings of an unhinged and
likely unmedicated Canadian woman I remember my delicious Guiness stout ale
sitting before me and put my phone back in my pocket to enjoy the ramblings
of unhinged boomers in my own presence.

Once my room is ready I wander over to the Ember Hostel in the Capitol Hill
neighborhood on the south side of downtown Denver. Tracy behind the desk checks
me in and notifies me of all the rules and regulations of the hostel. Most
importantly she lets me know about the St Paddys party they are throwing in the
common area of the hostel this evening. Beer pong, jello shots, flip cup, all
the hits. I am DOWN.

I mosey up to my room & situate my luggage and take a quick nap before the
festivities begin.

**Photo of my bunk**

At a quarter after 5 I wander down to the common area to find
a dozen or so guests & staff mulling around with a couple cases of Modelo. I
introduce myself and proceed to forget nearly everyone's name instantly. One of
the staffers tells us they've hidden gold coins around the hostel and each lucky
sleuth who finds one is entitled to a jello shot. I have a distinct altitude
advantage with an elevated line of sight as compared to most of the guests. I
parlay my lofty perch into a few jello shots before the beer pong begins.

It's quickly evident that everyone's beer pong peak has long since passed. Grab
any random two students from CU up in Boulder and they would easily dispatch
each and every competitor present. But we're having fun despite the pitiful
attempts at unsanctioned collegiate athletics. I actually manage to win a couple
games before we all matriculate outside for the more inclusive beer sport of
flip cup.

Outside I start chatting with a fella by the name of Allen who says he's been
living out of his van traveling around the country exploring nature and taking
odd jobs here and there every time he needs a few bucks.

The whole time we're out there Cody from Oklahoma is sitting around the fire pit
rolling an assembly line of joints. He works for a weed distributor in Oklahoma
and comes out to Colorado every few months for "research". I shouldn't have to
tell you that Cody is a popular man at the Ember Hostel.

Around 9 PM the group starts to get restless and begins making plans to take the
party to the bar. The question is posed if there's an Irish pub nearby & I
swoop in with the intel that there is, in fact, an Irish pub less than half a
mile away. This is the point I'm elected group leader by a silent vote that's
unanimously agreed upon and acknowledged as binding.

Everyone finishes their beers and we set out for the Fainting Goat with a thirst
for green beer & Guinness. Miraculously the crowded pub can accommodate our
group of strangers a dozen deep. Once inside everyone fans out looking for the
shortest queue for refreshments. I found a spot on the second floor bar where I
snag a pitcher of green beer and 3 Guinnesses because that's all I can carry.

I find most of the crew up on the rooftop balcony gathered around a rickety table
near the bar. I offer my gifts and they are eagerly accepted by the council. The
next two hours are spent on the roof with sporadic bursts of green beer,
Guinness, and Jameson shots.




<h4 class="article-subheader">You Go Left, I'll Go Right</h4>
I didn't realize my mistake until Johnny sprays me with sno as he skids to a stop
right in front of me
sweating bullets and cursing my guts. Johnny is my youngest brother. Johnny
hasn't skied in 10 years. Johnny is not happy.

"What the fuck??"

"Huh?"

"Why the hell did you tell me to go left? That was the hardest run I've ever
skied in my life!"

*gulp*

"Really? I thought that way was the easy way."

"Y'know what? It wasn't fucking easy! It was steep and full of big ass moguls.
I fell 4 times and didn't think I was ever gonna get down... Fuck you."

"Damn, that's my bad I really did think that was the easy way down"

"Well it wasn't... but I made it... let's go get on the lift... fuck you"

I sheepishly accept my well-deserved reprimand and we hop back on the Super Bee
chair at Copper Mountain.
So we did. And I went the way that I mistakenly steered Johnny and it was,
indeed, a real kick in the knackers. I was able to get down it *somewhat*
smoothly but I was drenched in sweat by the time
I reached the bottom. It reminded me of the frontside of
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/08-canada.html?id=burn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelstoke</a>.
I'm really amazed that Johnny was able to make it to the bottom, considering his
alpine hiatus and I've racked up 30 days on this trip alone. The young man is
tough as nails.

This bout of alpine athletics is taking place at Copper Mountain, a Colorado
ski resort just to the west of the North-South spine that forms the Tenmile
Range, which is host to Breckenridge. Josh Allen could launch a pigskin from
here to the
<a href="http://www.summitconcierge.com/breckenridge-ski-resort/imperial-express-superchair-breckenridge-colorado-ski-resort_id-203.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imperial Express chair</a>.


I pick up Johnny at his friend's apartment a little after 8 AM and head for I-70,
probably the most maligned stretch of ski-resort-bound road in the country. The
same demographic pressures that have overwhelmed Utah's
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/11-utah.html?id=canyons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canyon roads</a> have swamped I-70 West from Denver up
to the Colorado Plateau. The list of causes for I-70 logjams is long and ever
growing: ballooning numbers of skiers, inclement weather,
Texans who don't know how to drive in the snow, construction are among the most
consistent. It's such a problem that it has its own Instagram account

Luckily for us the typically roiling waters of I-70 part for us and
we are afforded smooth passage to Copper.

Awaiting us at the hill is my buddy Cameron, who has been working from his
parents' house in Pueblo, CO the past few months. He has a local ski pass at
a few Colorado mountains, and Copper just so happens to overlap with my Ikon
pass. He meets us at the bottom of the American Eagle lift after taking a few
spins while waiting for us to drive up from Denver and get Johnny outfitted with
some rental gear.


We load up the gear and head to Silverheels Tavern in Frisco for a few cold
ones and a big plate of nachos. I compliment Johnny's skiing acumen for such a
protracted absence from the sport.

Post-apr&egrave;s we make the 30 mile drive south to Leadville, the highest
incorporated city in the US at 10,152'. Leadville, if you can imagine this, is
an old mining town, one of the richest silver mining camps of the late 19th
century.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Have You Heard of Frozen Dead Guy Days?</h4>
A local named Jason asks me on the lift.
While I'm on the lift Jason tells me about Frozen Dead Guy Days. The hell is
Frozen Dead Guy Days you might ask? Well it's a weekend of debaucherous
nonsense in Nederland, CO, a town in the foothills of the Front Range outside
Boulder.

The origin of the story involves a frozen Nor

In 1989 a Norwegian fella by the name of Bredo Morst&#248;l took a heart attack
and departed this mortal existence to spend the rest of his days in the
resplendent halls of Valhalla with Odin and his valkyries. His grandson, Trygve
Bauge, however, had other ideas. Trygve packed grandpa in a sarcophagus of dry
ice and shipped him to the Trans Time cryonics facility in San Leandro, CA.
I'm sure everyone has at least heard of cryonics, knowledge of the actual
term notwithstanding (a dead rose by any other name would smell just as
rotten). It's the whimsical thought that you can freeze someone who has departed
their mortal coil for an indeterminate period of time in the hopes that a
thawing and resurrection will follow. I think I'm going to have to defer to
Wikipedia on this one, "It is generally viewed as a pseudoscience, and its
practice has been characterized as quackery."

But sometimes quackery can be fun. Especially when it doesn't hurt anyone.
Grandpa Bredo is dead. Keeping him frozen isn't hurting anyone.

While Popsicle grandpa chilled (sorry) at Trans Time for 3 years, Trygve was
developing grand plans for his own cryonics facility. In 1992 he petitioned the
Nederland government for permission to build such a facility. They resoundingly
turned him down. So he began building the facility.

Wait. What?

Trygve, roughly translates to "Never to be Deterred" in Norwegian,
used the money from the proceeds of the sale of his deceased grandfather's
summer cabin to fund the construction of his state-of-the-art cryogenic palace. By
the fall of 1993 Trygve was ready to bring grandpa to the palace. In what must
be another matter of mis-translation the ice palace was a shed behind the house.

After he was deported he said that "life extension and longevity go hand in
hand with Jeffersonian liberty," and I have to 


I find myself a parking space outside the stone building of the Nederland
Mining Museum. The town, located about 15 miles up Boulder Canyon, traces its
roots, as do so many mountain towns, to mining. Located in locations where the
enormous forces of plate tectonics have churned up the heavier minerals in the
Earth's crust into veins of concentrated and highly valuable ores. The most
notorious historical era for the town of Nederland occurred during WWI, a
period of wild speculation known locally as the "tungsten boom".

Up till that point tungsten was considered an impurity, thrown upon slag heaps
during the steelmaking process. The Germans were the first to realize the
strategic value of the element, building vast stockpiles in the years leading
up to the Great War. In a great tragic irony of history, much of that stockpile
was mined in Britain without so much as a fuss from the British. That is until
1912 when the
drumbeat of war became deafening and the British finally wised up to
the benefits of tungsten. But by that point it was already too late, as British
mining historian Ian Tyler glibly remarked that "nearly all our tungsten mined
up to 1912 we got back on the Somme."

Tungsten boasts the highest melting point and tensile strength among all the
metals and is nearly twice as dense as lead. A block of tungsten the size of a
microwave oven would weigh as much as the entire Arizona Cardinals offensive
line. As the Germans discovered, a
bit of tungsten sprinkled into molten iron produced a steel that is much
harder and resistant to heat and stress. In a struggle between enormous forts of
concrete and steel and immense artillery barrages designed to pummel these forts
it's easy to see why tungsten would be in such high demand.

And since tungsten is a trace element in the Earth's crust - clocking in at a
miniscule 0.000125% - when  In other words, there is only a single pound of tungsten in every
*800,000* pounds of crust (on average of course). That's 500 Arizona Cardinals
offensive lines.



Unfortunately for the British, the largest supplier of pre-war tungsten to
Germany was... the British. The Germans owned mines in Devon and Cornwall where
they 


As I make my way towards town it feels like I'm walking towards the stadium of a
college football game. People are just wandering, from where nobody knows, but
towards a central location. If we were all zombies and the festival was a
mountain of brains it would look just like this.

I eventually wind my corpse to the festivities, the main street of which
is crowded with folks moseying about, bros hanging from bar porches, substantial
food truck lines, and not a single beer purveyor in sight. I keep wandering
through the festivities till I reach the end of the street and find myself in
the mud section of the event. Luckily I wore my good mud stompin' boots.

This is where all the activities take place. As I splash through the muck and the
puddles towards the cacophonous noises of jeering crowds and a garbled PA
announcer I see the battlefield sprawled out in front of me. The grand arena is a
sloppy racetrack of mud and snow built for athletes by athletes in the lowest
possible part of town. Every drop of beer spilt on main street, every drop of
piss drizzled down upon a back alley bush matriculates to this spot.


I'm meandering around the main drag taking in all the lunacy of FDGD when I hear
Lowell George's mellifluous warble over the din of the crowd. You don't often
hear bars playing Little Feat, but when you do you got to go in.

Ned's is at the end of the main drag, away from the throngs of revelers so it's
slightly less mobbed than the rest of the dining and drinking establishments in
town. I'm able to find a spot at the bar and order myself a Frozen Dead Guy
Frigid Pale Ale. When in Rome.

Upon the arrival of my ale an older fella with a shock of white hair in a
disheveled ponytail leans over to discuss some inane topic or the other. Fred,
as I soon learn, has lived in Nederland the past 30 years. He's seen the
festival explode in popularity the past few years but doesn't besmirch the
crowds that mob his little town every spring. It breaks up the monotony. I just
think he likes having someone new to talk to at the bar.

Then after about 10 minutes of discussing the weather or something else equally
as boring, Fred leans over, completely unprovoked, and hits me with,

"I'm
pushing 60.. I'm 57.. Never been married and I don't know if I could marry a
woman my age. Once they get to 50 they start to fall apart."

*Awkward pause*

"And they get fat"

*Awkward pause redux*

"And they get fat in the worst places"

Well y'know Fred, I wasn't gonna say it but you look an awful lot older than 57.
A classic kettle-pot situation. I don't linger much longer to hear any more of
Cassanova Fred's opinions on the fairer sex.

I bop over to Crosscut Pizzeria and Taphouse, where I find a spot against the
rail on the back deck overlooking the bubbling waters of Middle Boulder Creek.
I enjoy an Upslope Citra Pale Ale from a platic cup while chatting with my
fellow patio patrons. I decide I better have one more before bidding Nederland
adieu.

Tonight I've booked lodging at a modestly priced accommodation called the
Millennium Harvest House in Boulder, where I should be able to find a public
house within walking distance to watch some March Madness. I deftly traverse the
winding road to Boulder, beating the FDGD crowd and the sun is still hanging on
when I arrive to the Millennium.

The hotel looks like it was built in the 1960s and hasn't been updated since.
Its so old that the architecture & decoration have swung so far past "old" that
it's likely now considered retro chic. I check in and walk down the swooping
hallway of the main building of the hotel to.. another building that's
connected to it, that's somehow connected to a third building, that winds around
to a fourth building? I think? It's a maze of hallways that would make perfect
sense to a local at Steamboat Springs.

I drop my bags in the only slightly dingy room and set off on foot. Right down
the road I find a nice watering hole called Backcountry Pizza & Tap House that
should work just fine. I sidle up to the bar and order myself an
ice cold Scenario Porter from our good friends at Melvin Brewing in Alpine, WY.
The dozen or so TVs in the joint
are all tuned to hoops. The game I'm really interested in doesn't start
for another half hour, a hardwood showdown between the
12 ranked New Mexico State Lobos and the 4 seed Arkansas
Razorbacks. I'm all-in on Arkansas tonight, I have them in my
March Madness pool where I select a team each day to win a-l&aacute; NFL
Survivor.

I finish my porter just as dem Peeeeeigs is about to tip off. I decide to switch
to an Insane Rush IPA from Bootstrap Brewing just down the road a piece in
Longmont and pair it with a slice of margherita and a half dozen wings. The
game is a low scoring affair, with Arkansas going nearly 8 minutes of game time
in the second half without a single point. The Lobos were only able to muster
a meager 6 points of their own in that stretch. If the entire game were played
at such a leisurely pace the final tally would add up to 30 points *combined*.

The second half is uncomfortably close, with Arkansas seeming to score off sheer
athleticism alone devoid of any resemblance of an offensive system. But in the end
the Hogs win 53-48 and I celebrate with a 2x4 Double IPA from Melvin, leaving
Backcountry happy, full, and more than slightly tipsy.

<h4 class="article-subheader">The Land of Enchantment</h4>
The trip is starting to wind down, 32 days of skiing down and only 1 to go. I
gather up my things in Boulder and say goodbye to the Millennium Harvest, the
second spookiest hotel I've stayed at on a ski trip behind only the
<a href="/traveler/2021_04-ski_trip/wp/day_5.html?id=timberline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timberline</a>. Before I leave town I make my way to
Chautauqua Park for a quick picnic in the shadow of the Rockies. The weather is
perfect and the park is filled with dozens of Boulderites enjoying a nice lazy Sunday.

I don't linger too long because I have 300 miles of highway on my schedule today
and they ain't gonna drive themselves. I load back into the Pathfinder and start
findin' a path. The first few hours are uneventful interstate boredom, south on
I-25 with the Colorado Front Range to my right. At the northern flank of the
Sangre de Cristo Mountains I dive West and see the familiar sights of Northern
New Mexico that I remember so fondly from my youth. It's probably been 20 years
since I've been here and a strange sense of nostalgic familiarity and newness
is running through my veins.

I pull into Red River just as the ski day is wrapping up. Well, it *should* be
wrapping up. As I pull into the parking lot for my accommodation I see hundreds
of people gathered at the base of the hill with music blasting. I stroll into
the lobby to check in & inquire what that's all about. The woman behind the
counter informs me that it's the last day of the season here at Red River & this
is the end of season party they do every year. Well that's a hell of a deal,
unintentionally walking into a big party.

I'm actually going to be skiing another mountain tomorrow, Taos, that is a few
hundred feet higher in elevation and about 45 minutes from here. I decided to
stay in Red River mostly for the nostalgia factor. This was where I came on my
very first ski trip and a handful of trips in the following years. It's a little
mountain town but it holds a large place in my heart.

I get checked in and dump my bags and walk over to the festivities to see what's
going on. I sidle my way up to a small pond built right at the bottom of "The
Face" a run that I remember being about the size of Mt Everest when I was a kid
that now looks so unimpressive that I have a minor existential crisis on what is
even real. Why might we all be gathered around a small pond at the bottom of a
ski run you might ask... Well this is why:


Closing day is quite the party. I stand down by the pond for a few skiers, some
successful, some not, and a handful of snowboarders, all unsuccessful, before
sauntering over to the lodge with a bustling second story balcony overlooking
the festivities. While waiting in line for a beer I see a fella decked out in a
fabulous head-to-toe shiny leopard print ski suit. Someone in the crowd asks
how Red River Liberace is doing to which he replies,

"Honey, if I were any peachier I'd be a cobbler!"

Outstanding.

I sidle through the crowd to the bar for a plastic cup full of Happy Camper IPA,
which I tote back out to the patio. The sun is shining, the senders are sending,
and the music is blasting. It's a glorious day to be in Red River. I hang out on
the patio until the festivities wrap up and I throw back my beer. By this point
I've worked up a hell of an appetite and I know the exact place to scratch that
itch.

Texas Red's Steakhouse is the basis for dozens of my fondest childhood memories.
Even when we weren't skiing in or staying in Red River we would make the trek
around Wheeler Peak for supper at Texas Red's. Unlike some of the other
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/08-canada.html?id=longhorn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saloons</a> and
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/10-cowboy_state.html?id=mdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taverns</a>
I've encountered on this trip, this place is the real deal.

</figure>

During the quarter mile stroll over to Texas Red's my mind is reeling with an
unhealthy carnal lust
for a medium rare T-bone steak. As I stride up the steps to the front door
I'm greeted with a horrifying sight that chills me to my bones.

as shit remember the second two against the goddamn Cowboys. This might hurt
worse.

I sit on the stoop for a minute and ponder if it's worth it to stay in Red River,
NM until May. I guess I'll mull it over with a beer.

I slowly trudge with my head hung low back towards the ski resort and duck into
the Red River Brewing Company. The place is jammed with people enjoying the
final days of skiing and watching March Madness. And I'd say 1 in 5 people are
wearing something from Oklahoma, which is pretty neat I reckon.

I put my name in for a table and grab a Powder Day Stout and pop a squat outside
on the patio around a gas firepit. Our old fabulous friend in the full leopard
skiing onesie sashays over

"Hey, I haven't seen you around, you must be new to town"

"Yeah I just got here today, just in time to see the pond skiing"

"Oh that's fun! It's our little crazy tradition for the close of ski season. I
don't ski but I dress the part. Name's Tyler, but everyone calls me Sweet T.
Don't ask me how long I've been here... It's been 7 years. By this point I know
everybody and everybody knows me. Is this your first time?"

"First time in probably 15 years, we came quite a few times when we were kids.
Everything seems so much smaller. It's all so different and so the same, it
feels... strange"

"Well it's our own little slice of heaven, we're not like those asshole ski
towns in Colorado"

"I agree. I like it here"

"Well that's fabulous, I hope you enjoy our little town"

"I sure will Sweet T"

I can't believe we've made it here. The end of the road. One more day of skiing
then it's back to reality. I'm a little sad just thinking about it.

I pack up my gear one last time and head to the slopes. It's about 45 minutes
around the base of Wheeler Peak, the loftiest of peaks in the state, to Taos Ski
Valley. A light flurry of snow is falling as I pull into the parking lot & load
onto the tractor-pulled open-air cattle car.

I must have been completely oblivious to most things as a child because none of
this looks familiar. You would have thought that I would retained at least a
faint recollection of the six-story Swiss chalet-style hotel and Bavarian
village at the base of the hill. I only learn later that most of this was built
within the past decade, after the 2013 sale of the resort and the $330 million
master development plan that came along with it. At least I haven't completely
lost my marbles.

I strap on the planks for one final time in the shadow of said six-story Swiss
chalet-style hotel ready to shred. I hop on the unimaginatively named Lift 1
up the face of the mountain, straight up Al's Run. One thing I notice as I ride
up is that this mountain is *steep*. I must have ridden up slopes steeper than
this on my previous 22 ski hills but I really can't remember when.

Off the lift I loop around to the right and dive down Spencer's. Of the hundreds
of runs I've taken this trip I'm confident in saying that this is in the top-5
toughest. The substantial moguls that have 

23,000' of vert, bringing my total just over 600k. My total skiing distance
is 560 miles.
