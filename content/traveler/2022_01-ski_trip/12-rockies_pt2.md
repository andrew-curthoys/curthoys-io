<h4 class="article-subheader">Oh Shit</h4>
I reach into my pocket to turn my music back on and.... no phone. No phone?

NO PHONE!!!

And a sinking realization sets in that I probably lost it forever. Doomed to a
snow covered grave.

Ok let's back up a second.

I'm at Arapahoe Basin right now.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Where the Hell Am I?</h4>
I exclaim as I unfurl the trail map for Steamboat Springs. I haven't been able
to get my bearings the whole damn day.

I was completely sure that I was headed to the mid-mountain lodge for some
lunch & a mid-day brewski when I found myself at the bottom of the Pony
Express lift. How I got here I don't know. What I do know is that I'm on chair
\#35 so I'm obligated to shoot my good friend Frank Dale a photo since everybody
knows that was his number when he played boundary corner for the Cascia Hall
Commandos.
