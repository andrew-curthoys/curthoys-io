<h4 class="article-subheader">Oh Shit</h4>
I reach into my pocket to turn my music back on and.... Nothing. An empty
jacket pocket. Well to be more precise a jacket pocket filled with lint and
air. But most certainly not filled with a phone.

A phone that I'm relying on for my directions home.

A phone that you take for granted until it's gone.

Maybe I got crazy and put it in another pocket? I frantically pat myself down
like I'm doing the Macarena at a minor league baseball game in 1997. I can do
all the lame dance moves I want but it ain't gonna bring my phone back.

And a sinking realization sets in that I probably lost it forever. Doomed to a
snow covered grave.

Ok I should probably back up a second.

I'm currently riding the Zuma Chair at Arapahoe Basin in Colorado.
The origin of the predicament within which I'm currently quartered began at the
loading area for this chairlift less than a half hour ago. I was waiting to
board when I noticed the sweet tunes coming from the liftie's speakers.

"Damn, these guys kick ass, who is it?"

"Yeah they are pretty great, it's a group called The Last Revel"

"Awesome, thanks man, I'm gonna turn them on right now"

And so I did. Or at least attempted to. The lower regions of the Montezuma
Bowl are cellularly challenged so I'll have to wait till the last few pylons
to jam out again.

As I reach the top of the lift the tunes start crankin' again and I click out of
my skis for one last hike up the ridge. It's not an especially grueling hike,
between 5-10 minutes, but with the elevation and unsure footing it requires a
deceptively high level of exertion.

It's totally worth it though, because the skiing is incredible. The terrain is
challenging yet approachable, a
wide-open bowl with adequately wide chutes perfect for sending. I have to
imagine the hike and intimidating heft of the immense crag brooding over the
ride up the chair deter most athletes because I have whole sections to myself.

Having said that I've reached the point of the day where the marginal cost of
lactic acid from the hike has begun to outweigh the marginal benefit of powder
chutes. Last hike run of the day, let's let 'er rip whaddya say?

I, indeed, let 'er rip, swooping smooth arcs through the fresh Colorado snow.
Unsurprisingly I've developed an admirable alpine acumen that can only come with
30 days of skiing in a season, more than thrice what I've done in any other season.
Somewhere in the middle of all those turns I hit the point of no cell reception
and my headphones go dark.

Or at least I thought I hit the point of no cell reception.

I now realize that it was my phone flying out of my pocket as I was flying down
the hill with an unzipped pocket. Real dumbass move. If the liftie had been
playing Nickelback I wouldn't be in this position.

With the depth of the snow on the mountain my phone is almost surely buried
under two feet of pillowy powder. But I do have a puncher's chance of finding
it. First, I have a general idea of where the music cut out. Unfortunately,
that also means I'll have to make the hike again. Second, I have my
headphones that should connect to the phone once I'm within a certain distance.

So that's my plan - retrace my steps and turn on my headphones every so often
to see if they'll connect. Hell, it's worth a shot.

I slide off the lift and lethargically mope up the hiking trail once more,
cursing myself for being so careless as to not zip up my damn pocket. Eventually
I find myself atop the Groswold chute and really throw a Hail Mary, turning
on the headphones to see if it's right up here at the top. No luck.

I make a few turns down from the top & try again. Nothing.

A few more turns. Nothing.

*swoosh swoosh swoosh*

Nada

*swoosh swoosh swoosh*

Zilch

*swoosh swoosh swoosh*

Nothin' doin'

*swoosh swoosh swoosh*

Noooooooope.

Ok you get the picture. I do this most of the way down the top section of the
mountain. That is until I reach the bottom of the chute, when after turning on
the headphones I hear an angelic robotic voice

<code>--Boop-- <i>Connected to Tiny Andy Dufresne.</i></code>\*

\*Don't ask my why I named my phone Tiny Andy Dufresne\*\*

\*\*Don't ask because I have no idea why.

Connected! That's a Bingo!!!!

I get my head on a swivel and that's when I see it, about 20 yards down the
hill from me, sitting on top of the snow flat as a pancake. Unbelievable.
I've mentioned it multiple times on this trip but I have no idea what I did to
deserve the ridiculous luck I've been afforded on my adventure but I'm not going
to question it. I'm just going to trust the process.

I slide right up to my phone, dust off the snow, and turn back on The Last
Revel. Hell yeah. Plus now I won't get lost.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Where the Hell Am I?</h4>
Whereas Arapahoe Basin was the last stop on my Colorado sojourn, Steamboat
Springs is my first. So I'm at Steamboat but *where* at Steamboat? As someone
who takes pride in his bearing keeping I've been lost all damn day.
I was completely sure that I was headed to the Four Points Lodge for some
lunch & a mid-day brewski when I found myself at the bottom of the Pony
Express lift. How I got here I don't know. What I do know is that I'm on chair
\#35 so I'm obligated to shoot my good friend Frank Dale a photo since everybody
knows that was his number when he played boundary corner for the Cascia Hall
Commandos.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">DALE</figcaption>
</figure>

My geographical confusion is confounded, at least in part, by the layout of the
resort. Not content with a single peak or even a couple, Steamboat Ski Resort
comprises 6 separate named peaks in a layout that'll make your internal compass
spin. All runs funnel down to a narrow runway leading to the base area, with
two beginner lifts and the Steamboat Gondola. The 9 minute ride up the gondola
drops you atop Thunderhead Peak, where the real fun begins. Behind Thunderhead
lies a sea of peaks, valleys, and saddles that all seem to surround each other
in a diabolical whirlpool of metamorphic schist. I have the utmost respect and
admiration for legendary ski map trail painter
<a href="https://jamesniehues.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James Niehues</a>,
but even he couldn't accurately portray the labyrinthine layout of Steamboat.
It's a ski resort fit for M.C. Escher.

So I'm on the Pony Express lift when I really want to be at the lodge drinking
a beer. On my way up I devour the trail map like I'm studying for the bar exam.
May it
Please the Court: I plan to take Longhorn down to the Wapiti cutover, which
should dump me right at the base of the Bar-UE chair. From there it's a quick
ride up & easy scoot down to Four Points and an ice cold bowl of loudmouth soup.

Off the chair I dump out to the right towards Longhorn. About halfway down I
dive into the short piste of Wapiti aaaaaaaaand there's no chair. I look up to
my left and the two seater is spinning about 200 yards up a side hill above a
copse of trees. You've GOT to be kidding me!!

My only option now is to ski the cat track all the way around the the side of
the mountain to the main base area. I dawdle over there & hop on the gondola,
which takes me to the Thunderhead Lodge and I am finally matched with my ever
illusory pint of suds.

I pack up my gear in the lot and head into town. It seems like a nice little
Colorado mountain town, 

I end up at the Barley Tap and Tavern and get myself a flight. It's a whole ordeal
of writing the numbers I want and. It was a typical flight situation, where I
write down the barley sammiches I'd like to try out and the fella brings em
to me. Well, partner, during the interim period between scribbling my selections
and the barkeep fulfilling those selections this ol boy plops down in the stool
next to me who seemingly started with a whiskey in his coffee this morning and
hasn't looked back.

So when the bartender brought back my mini wooden ski of small offerings of
delightful ale this dude lost his damn mind. Not only is he shithouse drunk he
apparently has never seen a flight of beer before, the combination of which seems
impossible.

"Whoaaa dude.. what's that??"

"Huh?"

"What did you get? How many beers is that? I didn't even know you could do that!!??"

"Uhh yeah it's a flight, you've never gotten a flight before?"

- I should mention here that this man appears to have aged to a ripe mid-30s, an
age where you'd expect someone to have at the very least *seen* a flight of beer.
If he was 22 I'd give him a pass but come on.

"Naw man, I normally only get Coors"

"Oh well they definitely don't have that here, what the hell are you doing in a
craft brewery then?"

"Well it started snowin' outside and it said beer on the sign so I just dove in
here"

I really can't fault him there.

"So what do you do, just tell them you want 4 beers and they bring them to you
or what?"

"Yeah," I deadpan as I look outside to see champagne powder piling up on the
sidewalks. I pull out my phone to
check for lodging options seeing as the Uncle Andy Inn will be quite
uncomfortable in this weather. It seems I'm the last person within 200 miles to
get the weather report because every hotel, airbnb, campsite, & RV park in town
is fully booked up for the night. The closest thing I can find is the _________
in Yampa????, about 30 miles west of town.


Waffle house hotel check in

<h4 class="article-subheader">Left at the Next Light!</h4>
I holler in my duties as the de facto navigator of this roving band of walking
miscreants. It's St. Paddy's Day and I'm on my way to the Fainting Goat Irish
Pub with a new group of friends I just met at today at my hostel in the Capitol
Hill neighborhood of Denver. I've been appointed the group's leader since I
bellied up to the same bar earlier this afternoon while my bed was readied at
the hostel.

While bellied up to the bar I heard one inebriated fella tell nobody and
everybody at the bar all at once, "I LOVE Prague! The thing about Prague is that
so many historical buildings survived the war because Hitler wanted to move his
headquarters there after the war!"

Which of course led me to a 5-star Tripadvisor review of Prague by a middle
aged Canadian woman simply entitled *"Prague--A City so Beautiful it was Spared
by Hitler"*

She goes on, in her own translation of Kampf 3:16,
<div class="mx-3 mb-3"><i>
Hilter so loved Prague, he wanted to save it for himself. When I heard this little-known fact, I just had to see it.
<br><br>
It is incredible to think the black heart of an evil dictator holds space for such reflection, Is it possible in some still moment he allowed the city's mysterious beauty to pause his disdain for humanity?
</i></div>

Later on in her review she writes whimsically,
<div class="mx-3 mb-3"><i>
Nothing compared to the experience of shopping the red- roofed Christmas markets with scents of fresh baked goods, sausages and hot mulled wine wafting by your nose. Christmas carols playing gently in the squares and every front door home to a small Christmas tree adorned in oranges, lemons, cinnamon and bows.
</i></div>
Before I'm fully sucked into the delusionary scribblings of an unhinged and
likely unmedicated Canadian woman I remember my delicious Guiness stout ale
sitting before me and put my phone back in my pocket to enjoy the ramblings
of unhinged boomers in my own presence.

Once my room is ready I wander over to the Ember Hostel in the Capitol Hill
neighborhood on the south side of downtown Denver.






I make my way towards Denver

<h4 class="article-subheader">Copper Cruisin'</h4>
Copper Mountain is _______

My good brother Johnny

I pick up Johnny at his friend's apartment a little after 8 AM and head for I-70,
probably the most maligned stretch of ski-resort-bound road in the country. The
same demographic pressures that have overwhelmed Utah's
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/11-utah.html?id=canyons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canyon roads</a> have swamped I-70 West from Denver up
to the Colorado Plateau. The list of causes for I-70 logjams is long and ever
growing: ballooning numbers of skiers, inclement weather,
Texans who don't know how to drive in the snow, construction are among the most
consistent. It's such a problem that it has its own Instagram account

Luckily for us the typically roiling waters of I-70 part for us and
we are afforded smooth passage to Copper.

Awaiting us at the hill is my buddy Cameron, who has been working from his
parents' house in Pueblo, CO the past few months. He has a local ski pass at
a few Colorado mountains, and Copper just so happens to overlap with my Ikon
pass. He meets us at the bottom of the American Eagle lift after taking a few
spins while waiting for us to drive up from Denver and get Johnny outfitted with
some rental gear.


We load up the gear and head to Silverheels Tavern in Frisco for a few cold
ones and a big plate of nachos. I compliment Johnny's skiing acumen for such a
protracted absence from the sport.

Post-apr&egrave;s we make the 30 mile drive south to Leadville, the highest
incorporated city in the US at 10,152'. Leadville, if you can imagine this, is
an old mining town, one of the richest silver mining camps of the late 19th

I arrive to the hostel on St Paddy's day, ready for some green beer. I check
in and the cheery young woman behind the counter lets me know they'll be hosting
a St. Paddys party at the hostel at 5 PM

<h4 class="article-subheader">Have You Heard of Frozen Dead Guy Days?</h4>
A local named Jason asks me on the lift.
While I'm on the lift Jason tells me about Frozen Dead Guy Days. The hell is
Frozen Dead Guy Days you might ask? Well it's a weekend of debaucherous
nonsense in Nederland, CO, a town in the foothills of the Front Range outside
Boulder.

The origin of the story is .....

I find myself a parking space outside the stone building of the Nederland
Mining Museum. The town, located about 15 miles up Boulder Canyon, traces its
roots, as do so many mountain towns, to mining. Located in locations where the
enormous forces of plate tectonics have churned up the heavier minerals in the
Earth's crust into veins of concentrated and highly valuable ores. The most
notorious historical era for the town of Nederland occurred during WWI, a
period of wild speculation known locally as the "tungsten boom".

Up till that point tungsten was considered an impurity, thrown upon slag heaps
during the steelmaking process. The Germans were the first to realize the
strategic value of the element, building vast stockpiles in the years leading
up to the Great War. In a great tragic irony of history, much of that stockpile
was mined in Britain without so much as a fuss from the British. That is until
1912 when the
drumbeat of war became deafening and the British finally wised up to
the benefits of tungsten. But by that point it was already too late, as British
mining historian Ian Tyler glibly remarked that "nearly all our tungsten mined
up to 1912 we got back on the Somme."

Tungsten boasts the highest melting point and tensile strength among all the
metals and is nearly twice as dense as lead. A block of tungsten the size of a
microwave oven would weigh as much as the entire Arizona Cardinals offensive
line. As the Germans discovered, a
bit of tungsten sprinkled into molten iron produced a steel that is much
harder and resistant to heat and stress. In a struggle between enormous forts of
concrete and steel and immense artillery barrages designed to pummel these forts
it's easy to see why tungsten would be in such high demand.

And since tungsten is a trace element in the Earth's crust - clocking in at a
miniscule 0.000125% - when  In other words, there is only a single pound of tungsten in every
*800,000* pounds of crust (on average of course). That's 500 Arizona Cardinals
offensive lines.



Unfortunately for the British, the largest supplier of pre-war tungsten to
Germany was... the British. The Germans owned mines in Devon and Cornwall where
they 


As I make my way towards town it feels like I'm walking towards the stadium of a
college football game. People are just wandering, from where nobody knows, but
towards a central location. If we were all zombies and the festival was a
mountain of brains it would look just like this.

I eventually wind my corpse to the festivities, the main street of which
is crowded with folks moseying about, bros hanging from bar porches, substantial
food truck lines, and not a single beer purveyor in sight. I keep wandering
through the festivities till I reach the end of the street and find myself in
the mud section of the event. Luckily I wore my good mud stompin' boots.

This is where all the activities take place. As I splash through the muck and the
puddles towards the cacophonous noises of jeering crowds and a garbled PA
announcer I see the battlefield sprawled out in front of me. The grand arena is a
sloppy racetrack of mud and snow built for athletes by athletes in the lowest
possible part of town. Every drop of beer spilt on main street, every drop of
piss drizzled down upon a back alley bush matriculates to this spot.

Right down the road from the Millennium Harvest I find a nice watering hole
called Backcountry Pizza & Tap House. I sidle up to the bar and order myself an
ice cold Scenario Porter from our good friends at Melvin Brewing in Alpine, WY.
The dozen or so TVs in the joint
are all tuned to March Madness. The game I'm really interested in doesn't start
for another half hour, a hardwood showdown between the
12 ranked New Mexico State Lobos and the 4 seed Arkansas
Razorbacks. I'm all-in on Arkansas tonight, I have them in my
March Madness pool where I select a team each day to win a-l&aacute; NFL
Survivor.

I finish my porter just as dem Peeeeeigs is about to tip off. I decide to switch
to an Insane Rush IPA from Bootstrap Brewing just down the road a piece in
Longmont and pair it with a slice of margherita and a half dozen wings. The
game is a low scoring affair, with Arkansas going nearly 8 minutes of game time
in the second half without a single point. The Lobos were only able to muster
a meager 6 points of their own in that stretch. If the entire game were played
at such a leisurely pace the final tally would add up to 30 points *combined*.

The second half is uncomfortably close, with Arkansas seeming to score off sheer
athleticism alone devoid of any resemblance of an offensive system. But in the end
the Hogs win 53-48 and I celebrate with a 2x4 Double IPA from Melvin, leaving
Backcountry happy, full, and more than slightly tipsy.

The trip is starting to wind down, 32 days of skiing down and only 1 to go. I
gather up my things in Boulder and say goodbye to the Millennium Harvest, the
second spookiest hotel I've stayed at on a ski trip behind only the
<a href="/traveler/2021_04-ski_trip/wp/day_5.html?id=timberline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timberline</a>. Before I leave town I make my way to
Chautauqua Park for a quick picnic in the shadow of the Rockies. The weather is perfect and the park is filled with dozens of
Boulderites enjoying a nice lazy Sunday.

I don't linger too long because I have 300 miles of highway on my schedule today
and they ain't gonna drive themselves. I load back into the Pathfinder and start
findin' a path. The first few hours are uneventful interstate boredom, south on
I-25 with the Colorado Front Range to my right. At the northern flank of the
Sangre de Cristo Mountains I dive West and see the familiar sights of Northern
New Mexico that I remember so fondly from my youth. It's probably been 20 years
since I've been here and a strange sense of nostalgic familiarity and newness
is running through my veins.

I pull into Red River just as the ski day is wrapping up. Well, it *should* be
wrapping up. As I pull into the parking lot for my accommodation I see hundreds
of people gathered at the base of the hill with music blasting. I stroll into
the lobby to check in & inquire what that's all about. The woman behind the
counter informs me that it's the last day of the season here at Red River & this
is the end of season party they do every year. Well that's a hell of a deal,
unintentionally walking into a big party.

I'm actually going to be skiing another mountain tomorrow, Taos, that is a few
hundred feet higher in elevation and about 45 minutes from here. I decided to
stay in Red River mostly for the nostalgia factor. This was where I came on my
very first ski trip and a handful of trips in the following years. It's a little
mountain town but it holds a large place in my heart.

I get checked in and dump my bags and walk over to the festivities to see what's
going on. I sidle my way up to a small pond built right at the bottom of "The
Face" a run that I remember being about the size of Mt Everest when I was a kid
that now looks so unimpressive that I have a minor existential crisis on what is
even real. Why might we all be gathered around a small pond at the bottom of a
ski run you might ask... Well this is why:


Closing day is quite the party. I stand down by the pond for a few skiers, some
successful, some not, and a handful of snowboarders, all unsuccessful, before
sauntering over to the lodge with a bustling second story balcony overlooking
the festivities. While waiting in line for a beer I see a fella decked out in a
fabulous head-to-toe shiny leopard print ski suit. Someone in the crowd asks
how Red River Liberace is doing to which he replies,

"Honey, if I were any peachier I'd be a cobbler!"

Outstanding.

I sidle through the crowd to the bar for a plastic cup full of Happy Camper IPA,
which I tote back out to the patio. The sun is shining, the senders are sending,
and the music is blasting. It's a glorious day to be in Red River. I hang out on
the patio until the festivities wrap up and I throw back my beer. By this point
I've worked up a hell of an appetite and I know the exact place to scratch that
itch.

Texas Red's Steakhouse is the basis for dozens of my fondest childhood memories.
Even when we weren't skiing in or staying in Red River we would make the trek
around Wheeler Peak for supper at Texas Red's. Unlike some of the other

<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/10-cowboy_state.html?id=mdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taverns</a> I've encountered on this trip, this
place is the real deal.

Sweet T in Red River.
