short_sum: We got real stoned & went to Blockbuster. What could go wrong?
summary: It's like we never left. Anyone reading this of a certain age remembers the ritual. The family loads into the car for the heady journey to the local Blockbuster, eager to peruse the shelves for a physical copy of the night's entertainment. You remember when your local store began the transition from VHS to DVD. No more need to be kind, rewind.

Blockbuster was the lynchpin for countless sleepovers, first
dates, and
<a href="https://bendblockbuster.com/product/blockbuster-and-chill-t-shirt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
*Netflix & chill*</a>
at a time when just the idea of Netflix would seem
ludicrous. To even access the internet you had to pay the 3-step AOL troll toll
of cacophonous robot noises blaring from
the tinny speakers on either side of your monitor. And you better hope
nobody in the house was expecting an important call.

The internet was a place where you had inane AIM conversations with your friends.
You were proud of your perfectly crafted, and upon retrospect, unbelievably
cringey screenname. You would spend an hour drafting a fabulous away message.
Untold hours on your terrible Angelfire page. The ***You've Got Mail*** guy.
Forums, flame wars, flash player. BRB, A/S/L, Y2K. Chat rooms. Oh chat rooms.

Napster was destroying the world. Myspace was cool. Abercrombie, Fitch, & frosted
tips.

It was a weird time.

But the one constant was Blockbuster. You were be guaranteed to share the store
with a few other customers mulling around weighing their options. Everyone had
their own strategy. I would do a quick lap around the perimeter,
keeping an active ranking of the new releases in my head. Occasionally I would
wander around the inner aisles, the comedy section, action, thriller. Horror
just to see the scary covers. I would never consider actually watching a horror
flick, I was a very frightened young man.

The moment you rented a movie with a red label the doomsday clock started
ticking, counting down until noon on the 3rd day. You had better slide that
sucker into the little slot by the time the clock struck zero,
lest you incur the dreaded late fee. You could have probably bought a used car
with the late fees that my family racked up over the years.

All that is to say that the Blockbuster video store in Bend, Oregon is like you
never left it. Apart from a small section at the back with Russell Crowe
memorabilia donated by John Oliver (we'll get to that), nothing has
changed. I was expecting somewhat of a spectacle, given that this is the last
remaining Blockbuster store on Earth, however the humdrum mundanity of the store
is the most remarkable aspect of the place. We find ourselves among a half dozen
other patrons walking the aisles, quietly scanning the titles like it's 1996,
deciding between *Independence Day* and *Twister*.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Make it a Blockbuster Night</h4>
"Ok I just had an idea, if we're going to do this, we should set some ground
rules"

"How do you mean?"

"If we're going to Blockbuster, we need the full '90s experience."

"Alright I'm down"

So we set some ground rules

* No GPS. We can check the map before we leave the motel, but once we cross that
threshold, no electronic guidance. If we get lost we'll have to ask for
directions or somehow find a paper map.
* No internet. If we have a question we're going to have to argue it out or
depend on the drunk guy at the end of the bar.
* Only 24 photos allowed all night. We're on the disposable camera limit.
* Texts & phone calls are only allowed as long as we're inside an establishment
that would have a landline.
* Landon is offered a special carve out: unrestricted communication is allowed
to his pregnant wife. I think that's fair.

And finally, not necessarily a period piece ground rule, but we agree upon it:
we must get *really* stoned. Because... I don't know, it's Blockbuster.

So those are the rules. Let's boogie.




<h4 class="article-subheader">Blockbuster Video</h4>
The story of Blockbuster is absolutely bananas.

The company began in Dallas after David Cook's oil & gas software business went
belly up in the
early 1980s. His cinephile wife Sandy encouraged him to look into the video
rental business, which at the time was a fragmented assortment of mom & pop
shops with limited inventories and an essentially non-existent selection of new
releases.

David leaned into his data/computer science background and created an automated 
system for inventory control, demographic tracking, and database management that
gave him an immediate and substantial leg up on the competition.
He also pioneered an experience, which now seems obvious, but at the time was
novel: he displayed the movies on shelves, which customers grabbed & ferried to
the front to checkout. I can only speculate on the status quo but I imagine it
was similar to a liquor store in a bad part of town.

In 1987, Wayne Huizenga, founder of Waste Management, and the man who some may
know as the former owner of the
Miami Dolphins, Florida Panthers, and Florida Marlins, took a
controlling stake in the company. It was he, not David Cook, who spurred on
Blockbuster's explosive growth in the late 80s/early 90s. By 1994, the company
was making $4 billion a year from 3,600 locations, making it larger than its
next 375 competitors combined. At its peak in 2004, Blockbuster boasted over
9,000 locations, with nearly 85,000 employees in 15 countries worldwide.

In 1994, Blockbuster trialed a concept known as the 
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/b3e752b1fb5cd382dfbea94475490126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Blockbuster Block Party</a>,
an indoor entertainment complex aimed at adults, consisting of restaurants, arcade
games, laser tag, motion simulator rides, and a "high-tech maze", whatever the
hell that means. The concept didn't take off, which is at the very least a bit
peculiar given that Dave & Busters operates 144 locations in the US with
essentially the same concept. D&B, a company that, in a bizarre coincidence, was also founded in the mid 80s in Dallas.

So that's pretty silly, but it doesn't really have anything to do with the
actual viability of Blockbuster as a company. Here's where it gets really
hilarious. In June of 1997, John Antioco, the
president of Taco Bell, resigned his post to become the CEO of Blockbuster.

That's right, *president of Taco Bell*.

To run a movie rental business.

What could possibly go wrong?

Well, unsurprisingly, it didn't take long for Taco John to shit all over
himself. In his first year he declined
an offer from Warner Brothers to exclusively rent this newfangled thing called
DVDs before they went on sale to the public. Walmart summarily swooped in and
within a few years surpassed Blockbuster as Hollywood's largest single source of
revenue. That's gotta sting worse than Taco Bell Diablo sauce on a paper cut.
Nowhere to go but up for Taco John right? Right? *Right?*

Well, just a few years later, *in the year 2000*, Taco John decided to turn down
another offer. This
time it was to buy a fledgling streaming video company. That company? You
already know... it was Netflix.

Biiiiiig oof.

A blunder big enough to get most people a nice kick in the ass on the way out
the door.

But, seeing as this is America, everyone is afforded 3 strikes. And boy did
Taco John take a gargantuan cut on strike three. After rebuffing two mega deals
that could have offered a lifeline to the struggling company he finally found a
deal that he liked. It was a partnership to create a video-on-demand
service, which on the face of it seems like a prudent decision. But... you're
going to laugh... the partner in the partnership?

<p class="fs-5 text-danger"><b><i>ENRON</b></i></p>

Enron!! Are you kidding me??? I wish I was joking.
As you can imagine, this didn't go so well. Taco John, take a bow, you 
single-handedly inflicted more damage to the health of Blockbuster than a 3 AM
Flamin' Hot&reg; Cool Ranch&reg; Doritos&reg; Locos Tacos Supreme&reg;.

Incredible.

So the taco guy didn't work out. Surely we can find someone to get us back on
track. Maybe someone in digital media, streaming, data... anything but fucking
tacos.

Sure, boss, anything but tacos. How do Slurpees sound?

Slurpees? What the hell are you talking about?

Jimmy Keyes is available.

For chrissake, Jimmy Keyes? Are you kidding me?... We need someone to sail this
ship out of Taco John's diarrhea sea & you suggest Jimmy Keyes???

Well.... We didn't look real hard, boss.

Actually... Y'know what? I don't give a shit... "Pam! Cancel all my meetings,
I'm gonna need the Scotch... Yes the one behind the 'BREAK IN CASE OF EMERGENCY'
glass... Yes, I'm serious... I don't know... You have a resume?
Yes you should update it... I don't know... I don't know... Yes you can leave
early... They're bringing in Slurpee Jim... I know... I know... That's what I
said"

So, in July 2007, James W. Keyes, president & CEO of 7-Eleven, took over as
chairman & CEO of Blockbuster. It's honestly admirable of Blockbuster to lean
into their death spiral in this way. Why hire someone with experience in digital
media to limp this carcass to bankruptcy when you can go out in an
incandescent ball of incompetent glory?

The part of the story I don't like is that before Slurpee
Jim took over Taco John was at
the helm for ***10 years***. How did it take that long to pull his
greasy taco fingers off the steering wheel of this station wagon careening
directly for a cliff?

Well we all know the story, Slurpee Jim predictably couldn't clean up the mess
that Taco John made and the company filed for bankruptcy in 2010. And thus ended
an empire.

Or did it?

The Wikipedia article for Blockbuster LLC states that
Blockbuster **was** "an American-based provider of home movie and video game
rental services." In my opinion, as long as the store in Bend, Oregon is still
in operation, Blockbuster **is** and American-based provider of home movie and
video game rental services.

And for the love of god don't let anybody even remotely related to Taco Bell
anywhere near this precious Central Oregon gem.

<h4 class="article-subheader">This Is It, Don't Get Scared Now</h4>
Before we venture out into the great unknown I check, double-check, re-check,
hip-check our directions. Once we set foot out that door no more relying on the
map.

Left on 3rd out of the Econolodge - quick left at on Franklin & under
the highway - right on Bond through downtown to the Oregrown Dispensary -
left out of the dispensary for about a mile - right on Revere & back under the
highway to paydirt.

Left-Left-Right-Left-Right-Blockbuster.

Seems easy enough.

We bundle up, grab a couple walkin' beers, and step foot back in time.
Left on 3rd, left on Franklin & under the highway. At the southern edge
of downtown we hang a right on Bond, pressing through Old Bend, past Bend
Brewing, past Deschutes, right to the doorstep of
Oregrown Dispensary. We both have about half a beer left & don't want to waste
them so we brainstorm.

"Let's just stick 'em in this bush"

Brilliant.

We scoot into the dispensary, voted "Best Dispensary" by
The Source Weekly five years running. It's Oregon's *most exciting herbal
experience*. The bubbly receptionist takes our
name and we have a seat in the waiting room. Our fellow pot patrons are merry;
we have a conversation with some older women about what junk food & reality TV
shows they plan to watch that night. A weed store waiting room is the
adult equivalent of a minivan ride to an ice cream parlor. But
instead of chocolate chip, rocky road, and Cherry Garcia, we have platinum
huckleberry, lemon sour diesel, and skunk in the trunk.

After a short wait they call our name and the receptionist leads us through a
door and introduces us to our budtender.

"What's happenin' fellas, how can I help ya?"

"Uhhhhhh"

I gawk at the bewildering assortment of cannabis crops, concoctions, and
contrivances.

"I guess we'll take a pen?"

"Right on man, do you need a battery & cartridge or just the cart?"

"Uhhhhhh"

"No worries man, I'll get you all set up. Ok now what are we looking for, a body
high? Head high? Indica, sativa, hybrid? I've got a great granddaddy purp right
here, chery pie slurricane, super lemon haze, jet fuel gelato, watermelon
brain grenade, death star OG, and of course, the golden goose hindu kush."

I give him a look that I hope signified *how the hell do you expect me to know
any of that*

"Ahhh alright man, alright.. I'll recommend the pineapple upside down cake, it's
an indica/sativa hybrid that will give you a nice mellow high without knocking
you on your ass, it's probably our most popular strain"

"Sounds good to me superchief"

The whole experience was like a non-judgemental soup nazi kitchen. Overwhelming, yet
welcoming at the same time. If you can't tell electric lettuce is not my vice of
choice. Don't touch the stuff. So I am still in a fog of bewilderment as we exit
the establishment.

We hang a left to continue our Northward journey on Bond.

Should we have sprung for the mountainside llama bomb? The magnetic space
thruster? The spectrum?

"Oh shit.. the beers!"

We double back to the bush to grab our road sodas. Conveniently, we find thick
clump of trees upon which to relieve ourselves and within which to take a rip of
the jazz cigarette.

sssssssswwwwwwwwwppppppp.......

...............

yeaaahhhhuhhhh.......

...............

It's hitttttinnnnnn phhhhwwwwwwwwwww.......

...............

Our mind is clear.

Our purpose is in focus.

Our mission is....

What's our mission again?


<h4 class="article-subheader">Russell Crowe Has Entered the Chat</h4>
In early 2018, the Bend location was one of four remaining Blockbusters. The
others, all located in Alaska, drew the attention of *Last Week Tonight's* John
Oliver. In an episode of *LWT*, Oliver revealed his attempt to help
the Anchorage store stay afloat "by doing something breathtakingly stupid."

How stupid you may ask?

Well in April 2018, Russell Crowe held an auction to "celebrate" his divorce from
his wife Danielle Spencer. Over 200 items that were used by Crowe in his films
were put up for sale, including the vest he wore in 2012's *Les
Mis&eacute;rables*, his hood from 2010's *Robin Hood*, and most notoriously,
his jockstrap from 2005's *Cinderella Man*.

Oliver acquired the aforementioned memorabilia in the auction, sending the items
to the Anchorage store in the hopes that they would draw visitors.
Unfortunately, the paraphernalia couldn't save the suffering store, which shut
its doors in July 2018. This left the Bend location as the last remaining
Blockbuster Video on the planet. In the process of closing up the Anchorage
store, the items were sent to Bend, where they are on display in all their glory.

<iframe class="col-12 mb-3 video-div" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Btvu2h0Jc-A" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In a hilarious coda to this story, Russell Crowe, upon hearing of Oliver's
hijinks decided to get in on the fun himself. He took the proceeds from the items
sold to *Last Week Tonight* and put them to charitable purposes. In a video
produced by Crowe, he revealed that he donated the money to the Australia Zoo
Wildlife Hospital, run by Steve Irwin's family (yes, that Steve Irwin). They
are using the money to develop a vaccine to help Koalas suffering from a disease
that can cause blindness, infertility, and even death.

The disease? Chlamydia.

And such is the tale behind *The John Oliver Koala Chlamydia Ward*.

<h4 class="article-subheader">I Have to Return Some Videotapes</h4>
The sign for Revere St. gleans in my eye and I stop dead in my tracks. We've
reached the final ridge. One final push to the summit. The entertainment
precipice beckons.

But first a train. Maybe.

The horns are blaring, the lights are flashing, the arms of
the railroad crossing are down.

But there ain't no train.

Cars are backed up. Drivers look agitated. But it's not the normal "I'm sitting
at a railroad crossing" agitated. It's an "I've been sitting at this railroad
crossing for 15 minutes without a goddamn train" agitated.

We look left. We look right. Wait.

No train.

We creep up to the crossing.

No train.

So we walk across.

Dumbass cars.

They only have their dumb wheels.

They can't even go around the railroad crossing arms.

They can't even parkour.

Dumbass cars.

And then we see it. A blue and yellow shining beacon of entertainment freedom.
The guiding light of Millennial adolescence. The star of Bendlehem. It's
beautiful.

Like sugar deprived children bursting into Russell Stover's we walk into the last
Blockbuster on Earth, high as Seth Rogan on a Tuesday. The glass doors direct us
to the right upon entry. I can't say for sure that
*all* Blockbusters directed you to the right, but all the ones I
remember did.

The second I step foot inside a sort of autopilot kicks in, a sensory impulse
honed over hundreds of adolescent trips to the foremost authority on feature
film rentals.
I find myself subconsciously walking through the new releases section.

Perusing. Browsing. Ranking.

I begin formulating an argument for my choice over whatever the hell Landon
picks. Although, given his affinity for ducks, I really hope he doesn't pick
*The Mighty Ducks*. I don't know if I could argue against Gordon Bombay &
Charlie Conway's Triple Deke.

Should I go for a new release? Or am I in the mood for a classic? Seeing as
we're in full-on 90s mode maybe an Adam Sandler vehicle?

The satisfaction of walking through a physical wall of movies is immensely
superior to flicking your thumb through Netflix. With Netflix you have no
peripherals. You're on the jungle floor. At Blockbuster you're swinging through
the canopy, the entirety of your entertainment kingdom sprawled below. It's
magnificent.

I mentioned it before but cannot stress enough how unremarkable this store is.
There's no fanfare. No ballyhoo. Not even a hubbub! We're joined in the store by
a handful of other people, quietly shuffling through the aisles, reaping their
motion picture harvest. If you snagged someone from the Clinton administration
and dropped them here,
some 20-odd years in the future, I think their only comment might be
"what's that stuff in the display cases in the back?" And perhaps "what the hell
is a chip card?"

It's extraordinarily ordinary. Even the popcorn ceilings and fluorescent lights
are boring as shit.

</figure>

We make our way to the back of the store, to the Russell Crowe memorabilia
display. The hood from *Robin Hood*, the vest from *Les Mis&eacute;rables*, the
Gentleman Jim Braddock boxing robe from *Cinderalla Man*. Conspicuously absent
is the jockstrap. Upon further investigation (the next day of course, no
internet tonight) I find that the
jockstrap was not included in the shipment from Alaska to Bend. Its whereabouts
were uncertain until *Last Week Tonight* located it in November 2018. It brings
me great pleasure to know that the garment is in safe hands.

In addition to the Russell Crowe memorabilia, the store displays an assortment
of nostalgic nicknacks, my favorite of which is a copy of *Home Alone 2: Lost in
New York* on LaserDisc. I think that's worth the trip to Bend in and of itself.

Oh. There's one *small* detail I may have forgotten to divulge. 

We don't have a DVD player.

So all that talk of choosing a movie was completely pointless. Did I mention
we're stoned? But we came to Blockbuster for the experience anyway. If we wanted
to lay on the glorified hay bales that the Econolodge calls beds & watch a movie
why would we walk all the way here? I mean.. we have Netflix.

But like the contestants on every 90s gameshow we "couldn't leave empty handed."
And seeing as this Blockbuster is the same as every Blockbuster you
remember, we are required to navigate through the candy maze before exiting the
establishment.

Stoned guys.

Candy maze.

A match made in heaven.

The girl working the counter must be used to dumbass tourists frequenting the
store because she was completely unfazed by our moronic discussion of the
relative merits of various treats. Luckily the store wasn't busy for our
confectionary confabulation clogging the candy maze.

We decide that tonight's particular
variety of stoned has us hankerin' for frozen novelties. Landon opts for the
Snickers ice cream bar, which used to be my go-to, but I have recently been
converted to the Church of Twix Ice Cream Bar. I don't want to talk about the
initiation ritual, but by god is it a délicieuse friandise.

<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/bb_receipt.jpeg" alt="Novelties">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">We came. We saw. We bought novelties.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4 class="article-subheader">Well Now What?</h4>
I reckon there's nothing left to do now other than head back to downtown
to continue the merrymaking. I should mention here that Landon's sense of
direction tonight has been atrocious. Every single intersection he suggests is the
*exact opposite* direction. And it doesn't just happen a few times, it's every.
single. intersection. I still don't know to this day if it was just the pot or
he was fucking with me. He also had to pee about 100 times throughout the night.
It was an absurd evening to say the least. 

So we depart the Blockbuster 180&deg; from where Landon wants to go, headed back
to downtown. We stop at the first tavern we see and belly up to the bar. The
bartender hands us a menu and gives us a few minutes to decide on our swill of
choice. Now I'm still really stoned and the words on the menu enter my right
eyeball and disappear completely from my cognition by the time my left has
reached them. I'm in a stupefying torpor when the bartender swings back by.

"What'll ya have?"

"Uhhhhhh.... can we get a few more minutes?"

"Sure thing"

A few more minutes of ineffectual menu scanning. My brain's CPU has gone
dormant.

"Ok, so what did you guys decide on?"

I panic

"Ahhhhhhh I'll take...... a......... PBR"

"Seriously? You took 10 minutes to decide on a PBR?"

Call Stanley's! We're gonna need a hearse to haul away my corpse. Death by
bartender barb. Directly in
front of my stupid face are at least a dozen tap handles, supplying
mouthwatering craft suds from a collection of breweries that are within walking
distance. And we went with PBR.

The bartender gives us the business but we all have a good laugh.

We throw back our blue ribbon award winning pilsners before settling up and
continuing the journey. Now I have no rational reason for our next decision,
maybe it was a subconscious overcorrection for the PBRs, maybe the pineapple
upside down cake had us feeling fancy, whatever the case we inexplicably
stroll into a wine bar.

Why on Earth anybody in our condition would walk into a wine bar is beyond me.
In an act of abject irresponsibility they seat us at the bar and hand us a wine
menu. I say this not in the sense that we shouldn't be served *alcohol* - we
have only had a few beers over the course of the evening - it's that we
shouldn't, under any circumstances, be served fine wine.

But, it's Blockbuster night, nothing makes sense. As a tiny consolation
the high is beginning to wear off so I can actually comprehend this menu. I
pretend like I have some idea what the hell I'm talking about and order the 2018
Domaine Serene 'Grand Cheval' Oregon Red Wine, a Syrah/Pinot Noir blend that
"looks like your most full bodied offering, we've really been hammering our
palate tonight." I'm an idiot.

We enjoy the red wine like a couple of snobbish dipshits. They could have poured
us a $5 bottle of bag wine & we wouldn't have been the wiser. The highlight of
the wine bar had to be a woman who was *very* upset that they didn't have a
table for her. There's something about entitled assholes not getting their way
that just makes life that much sweeter.

</figure>

We conclude our nonsensical oenophilic foray and agree we need a change of
scenery. It doesn't take long for us to set our eyes on the billiards tables of
Sidelines Sports Bar & Grill. This is much, much more our speed, us hayseeds
from Oklahoma race on good ol American Goodyears, not those effete Pirellis.

We reserve ourselves a table and order up a round of Ranier tallboys. I conduct
myself admirably for the first few games, but as one Ranier turns into many my
billiards acumen drops precipitously. Our skills on the pool table approach the
