<h4 class="article-subheader">It's like we never left</h4>

Anyone reading this of a certain age remembers the ritual. Everybody loads into
the car for the heady journey to your local Blockbuster, eager to peruse the
shelves for a physical copy of
the night's entertainment. You remember when your local store began the
transition from VHS to DVD. No more need to
<a href="https://bendblockbuster.com/product/blockbuster-be-kind-t-shirt-v2-blue/">
*be kind, rewind*</a>.
Blockbuster was the lynchpin for countless sleepovers, first
dates, and
<a href="https://bendblockbuster.com/product/blockbuster-and-chill-t-shirt/">
*Netflix & chill*</a>
at a time when just the idea of Netflix would seem
ludicrous. To even access the internet you had to pay the 3-step AOL troll toll
of cacophonous robot noises blaring from
the tinny speakers on either side of your monitor. And you better hope
nobody in the house was expecting an important call.

The internet was a place where you had inane AIM conversations with your friends.
You were proud of your perfectly crafted, and upon retrospect, unbelievably
cringey screenname. You would spend an hour drafting a fabulous away message.
Untold hours on your terrible Angelfire page. The ***You've Got Mail*** guy.
Forums, flame wars, flash player. BRB, A/S/L, Y2K. Chat rooms. Oh chat rooms.

Napster was destroying the world. Myspace was cool. Abercrombie, Fitch, & frosted
tips.

It was a weird time.

But the one constant was Blockbuster. You were be guaranteed to share the store
with a few other patrons mulling around weighing their options. Everyone had
their own strategy. I would do a quick lap around the perimeter,
keeping an active ranking of the new releases in my head. Occasionally I would
wander around the inner aisles, the comedy section, action, thriller. Horror
just to see the scary covers. I would never consider actually watching a horror
flick, I was a very frightened young man.

The moment you rented a movie with a red label the doomsday clock started
ticking, counting down until noon on the 3rd day. You had better slide that
sucker into the little slot by the time the clock struck zero,
lest you incur the dreaded late fee. You could have probably bought a used car
with the late fees that my family racked up over the years.

And remember the membership cards?

All that is to say that the Blockbuster video store in Bend, Oregon is like you
never left it. Apart from a small section at the back with memorabilia donated
by John Oliver by way of an Alaska store that has since shuttered, nothing has
changed. I was expecting somewhat of a spectacle, given that this is the last
remaining Blockbuster store on Earth, however the humdrum mundanity of the store
is the most remarkable aspect of the place. There are about a half dozen other
patrons walking the aisles, quietly scanning the titles like it's 1996, deciding
between *Independence Day* and *Twister*.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Blockbuster Video</h4>
The story of Blockbuster is absolutely bananas.

The company was started in Dallas by David Cook, a fella whose oil & gas
software business went bust when the bottom dropped out of the oil barrel in the
early 1980s. His wife Sandy who encouraged him

In 1987, Wayne Huizenga, founder of Waste Management and owner of the Miami
Dolphins, Florida Panthers, and Florida Marlins until his death in 2018, took a
controlling stake in the company. It was he, not David Cook, who spurred on
Blockbuster's explosive growth in the late 80s/early 90s. By 1994, the company
was making $4 billion a year from 3,600 locations, making it larger than its
next 375 competitors combined.

In 1994, Blockbuster trialed a concept known as the 
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/b3e752b1fb5cd382dfbea94475490126">
Blockbuster Block Party</a>,
an indoor entertainment complex aimed at adults housing a restaurant, arcade
games, laser tag, a motion simulator ride, and a "high-tech maze", whatever the
hell that means. The concept didn't take off, which couldn't be for lack of a
market, given that Dave & Busters 144 locations in the US of essentially the
same concept. A company that, in a bizarre coincidence, was also founded in the
mid 80s in Dallas.

Here's where it gets really hilarious. In June of 1997, the president of Taco
Bell, John Antioco, resigned his post to become the CEO of Blockbuster. That's
right.. In June of 1997 the CEO of
Blockbuster was a resigned as the
president of Taco Bell to become CEO of Blockbuster.Just read this sentence from Blockbuster's
Wikipedia page: "*In June 1997, Taco Bell president John Antioco
resigned from the company to become CEO of Blockbuster.*" The hilarious stupidity
of that scenario is incredible. I mean, what could possibly go wrong?

Well, unsurprisingly, it didn't take long for Taco John to shit all over
himself. In his first year he declined
an offer from Warner Brothers to exclusively rent this newfangled thing called
DVDs before they went on sale to the public. Walmart summarily swooped in and
within a few years surpassed Blockbuster as Hollywood's largest single source of
revenue. That's gotta sting worse than Taco Bell Diablo sauce. Nowhere to go but
up for Taco John right? Right? *Right?*

Well, just a few years later Taco John decided to turn down an offer to buy a
fledgling streaming video company. That company? You already know, it was
Netflix. Biiiiiig oof.
But, seeing as this is America, and everyone is afforded 3 strikes, and boy did
Taco John take a gargantuan cut. He
spearheaded a partnership with Enron to create a video-on-demand service, which
as you can imagine, didn't go so well. He
single-handedly inflicted more damage to the health of Blockbuster than a 3 AM
Flamin' Hot&reg; Cool Ranch&reg; Doritos&reg; Locos Tacos Supreme&reg;.

So the taco guy didn't work out. Surely we can find someone to get right this
ship. Maybe someone in digital media, streaming, data... anything but fucking
tacos.

Sure, boss, anything but tacos. How do Slurpees sound?

Slurpees? What the hell are you talking about?

Jimmy Keyes is available.

For chrissake, Jimmy Keyes? Are you kidding me?... Y'know what? I don't give a
shit. Bring in Jimmy Keyes.

James W. Keyes, president & CEO of 7-Eleven, took over as chairman & CEO
in July 2007. What level of insanity that you hired a guy from 7-Eleven when your
biggest threat is in streaming media. in and of itself, but the date suggests that Taco
John was at the helm for *10 years*. How did it take that long to pull his
greasy taco fingers off the steering wheel of the station wagon headed for the
cliff?

Well we all know the story, the slurpee slinger predictably couldn't turn it
around and the company filed for bankruptcy in 2010. And thus ended an empire.
Or did it?

The Wikipedia article for Blockbuster LLC states that
Blockbuster **was** "an American-based provider of home movie and video game
rental services." In my opinion, as long as the store in Bend, Oregon is still
in operation, Blockbuster **is** and American-based provider of home movie and
video game rental services.

For the love of god don't let anybody even remotely related to Taco Bell
anywhere near this precious gem.

<h4 class="article-subheader">It's Blockbuster Night</h4>
"Ok I just had an idea, if we're going to do this, we should set some ground
rules"

"How do you mean?"

"If we're going to Blockbuster, we need the full '90s experience."

"Alright I'm down"

So we set some ground rules

* No GPS. We can check the map before we leave the motel, but once we cross that
threshold, no electronic guidance. If we get lost we'll have to ask for
directions or somehow find a paper map.
* No internet. If we have a question we're going to have to argue it out or
depend on the drunk guy at the end of the bar.
* Only 24 photos allowed all night. We're on the disposable camera limit.
* Texts & phone calls are only allowed as long as we're inside an establishment
that would have a landline.
* Landon is offered a special carve out: unrestricted communication is allowed
to his pregnant wife. That's reasonable.

And finally, not necessarily a period piece ground rule, but we agree upon it:
we must get really stoned.

So those are the rules. Let's boogie.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Mount Up</h4>
I check, double-check, re-check, and check again our directions. Once we set
foot out that door no more relying on the map.

Left on 3rd out of the Econolodge - quick left at on Franklin & under
the highway - right on Bond through downtown to the Oregrown Dispensary -
left out of the dispensary for about a mile - right on Revere & back under the
highway to paydirt.

Left-Left-Right-Left-Right-Blockbuster.

Seems easy enough.

We bundle up, grab a couple walkin' beers, and step foot back in time. This is
it don't get scared now.

We head out from the Econolodge & under the highway. At the southern edge
of downtown we make a right on Bond. Everything going according to schedule. We
head through downtown, past Bend Brewing & Deschutes, to the doorstep of
Oregrown dispensary. We both have about half a beer left & don't want to waste
it so we brainstorm.

"Let's just stick 'em in this bush"

Brilliant.

Our biggest concern about the Bush Plan is to remember to grab them after
leaving the dispensary. Should be easy enough.

We scoot across the road to the Oregrown Dispensary, voted Best Dispensary by
The Source Weekly five years running, Oregon's most exciting herbal experience.
The bubbly receptionist takes our
name and we have a seat in the waiting room. Our fellow pot patrons are merry;
we have a conversation with some older women about what junk food & reality TV
shows they plan to watch that night. The waiting room at the pot store is the
adult equivalent of taking a ride in the minivan to the ice cream store. But
instead of chocolate chip, rocky road, and Cherry Garcia, we have platinum
huckleberry, lemon sour diesel, and skunk in the trunk.

After a short wait they call our name and the receptionist leads us through a
door and introduces us to our budtender.

"What's happenin' fellas, how can I help ya?"

"Uhhhhhh"

I gawk at the bewildering assortment of cannabis crops, concoctions, and
contrivances.

"I guess we'll take a pen?"

"Right on man, do you need a battery & cartridge or just the cart?"

"Uhhhhhh"

"No worries man, I'll get you all set up. Ok now what are we looking for, a body
high? Head high? Indica, sativa, hybrid? I've got a great granddaddy purp right
here, chery pie slurricane, super lemon haze, jet fuel gelato, watermelon
, death star OG, , of course, the golden
goose hindu kush."

I give him a look that I hope signified *how the hell do you expect me to know
any of that*

"Ahhh alright man, alright.. I'll recommend the pineapple upside down cake, it's
an indica/sativa hybrid that will give you a nice mellow high without knocking
you on your ass, it's probably our most popular strain"

"Sounds good to me superchief"

The whole experience was like a non-judgemental soup nazi. Overwhelming, yet
welcoming at the same time. We settle up with the cashier and continue our
journey to Blockbuster.

"Oh shit.. the beers!"

We double back to the bush to grab our road sodas & find thick clump of trees to
relieve ourselves and take a rip of the jazz cigarette.

sssssssswwwwwwwwwppppppp......

...............

yeaaahhhhuhhhh.......

...............

<p class="section-divider my-4">&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;</p>

The pen had ink.

<p class="section-divider my-4">&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;</p>

We continue north on Bond.

Our mind is clear.

Our purpose is in focus.

Our mission is....

<h4 class="article-subheader">Blockbuster Video</h4>


<h4 class="article-subheader">Go 'Cuse</h4>


We had a 5 minute conversation but for the life of me I have no idea what it
was about. I remember Landon asking me what the hell we were talking about,
I remember the process of telling him what the hell we were talking about, when
I'm stopped dead in my tracks. The sign for Revere St. gleans in my eye and I
stop dead in my tracks.

I've never climbed Everest.

But that goes without saying.

But why did I say it.

Why do people say anything.

How do sayings get started.

Who invented English?

Ok I'm not that high.

.... But maybe I am.

The railroad arms are down, the horns are blaring, the lights are flashing.

But there ain't no train.

The cars are backed up. We look left. We look right. Wait. Which side of the
rail do trains drive on? Should we look left first? Right first? Is that
Buster Keaton on the front of that train

We creep up to the railroad crossing. The feeling when bipedal transportation
supplants the internal combustion engine is blissful.

Cars are dumb.

They only have their dumb wheels.

Cars can't even parkour

Cars can't even go up a stairwell

Cars can't even go up an ADA approved ramp

Dumbass cars.

The arms are down. The horns are blaring. The lights are flashing.

I can't see a train for the life of me.

Well I guess we should head for the summit.

We cross the tracks, showing the superiority of the pedal method of transportation,
these dumbass cars, waiting here for the train like a bunch of morons.


Can you see the peak of Everest the whole time?

Why is it named Everest?

Is it the tallest mountain Everest?



We walk in, the glass doors directing us to the right. I can't say for sure that
*all* Blockbusters directed you to the right upon entry, but all the ones I
remember did.

Did all Blockbusters go to the right?

Is that a thing?

What the fuck is *Never Back Down: Revolt*?

A sort of autopilot kicked in, honed over hundreds of adolescent trips to
Blockbuster. I found myself subconsciously walking through the new releases
section,,perusing, browsing, weighing my options. Formulating an argument for
why we should choose it over whatever the hell Landon picks.

We don't have a DVD player.

The satisfaction from walking through a physical wall of movies is immensely
superior to flicking your thumb through Netflix. With Netflix you have no
peripherals. You're on the jungle floor. At Blockbuster you're swinging through
the canopy, the entirety of your entertainment kingdom sprawled below.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Speaking of Netflix</h4>


My brain jettisoned any possible remnant of the asinine conversation I had with
the old Syracuse shirt man. The summit beckons. We're headed.
