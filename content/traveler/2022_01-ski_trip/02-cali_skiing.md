summary: 

Bills victory Monday feels so so sweet. James & I wake up with the Bills
officially AFC East Champions with a collision course with the New England
Patriots at Highmark Stadium. We gather our things and head down the road a piece
to a juicery to give our bodies some nutrients they've surely been missing.

We grab our green juices like a couple of Santa Monica divorcees and head to the
nightmare that is LAX. It's a quick drive and the airport is much less of a zoo
than it normally is. For that I will not complain. We're here to scoop up two of
James's friends who are coming along for skiing. Seeing as I've packed for 2
months of road trippin' the space in the wagon is limited. We spend about 15
minutes in the passenger pickup lane packing, repacking, jostling, rejostling,
until we finally load up the clown car to the brim.

Next stop: Mammoth Lakes, CA, about 5 hours due North, on the eastern side of the
Sierra Nevada mountains. The traffic leaving LA is surprisingly light and soon
enough we're on highway 395 flanking the Southern foothills of the Sierras. The
mountains begin to rise to our left in an arid landscape with yuccas, Joshua
