<h4 class="article-subheader">The Crossroads of the West</h4>
I ring the doorbell and I'm greeted with open arms by Bob & LaGayle & their
roving gang of canine hooligans, Geno, Crosby, ?fifi?, and ?other?. I unload
my gear and they show me to my room. They have a beautiful home and I'm less
than half an hour from 4 incredible ski resorts on my Ikon pass. I feel like I've
died & gone to Utah.

We catch up over the delicious supper LaGayle has prepared, me of the exploits
of the previous ten posts of this adventure, them of their goings on since we
last saw each other two decades ago. One story in particular has stuck with me,
I remember Bob telling a story about a young relative or family friend who was
tagging along with Bob on the slopes. At one point Bob told the young lad to
scoot down aa groomer as he ducked into the trees & they would meet up at the
lift. Well apparently the youngster didn't get the memo and followed Bob into
the trees and got himself in quite a bind.

The thing that stuck with me so strongly as a 12 year old flatlander when
hearing the tale is that someone could possibly ski through the trees. It really
blew my mind. I thought Bob must have been an Olympic caliber skier, which he
wasn't far from - he was on the ski team at Dartmouth and was a monster on a
pair of planks. I say "was" because he was forced into early retirement after a
terrible car accident that he & LaGayle survived way back in Y2K. They are
fortunate and grateful for their health but after the accident Bob's doctors
advised him to hang em up. I can still see a glimmer in his eye every time I talk
about the mountains I've skied or my plans for Utah. It's a combination of
living vicariously and a 

We continue to chat after dinner, LaGayle telling stories of the fun that she
used to have with my mom & grandpa in Tulsa. Those were the days.

Last week while in Big Sky I got a text out of the blue from my best bud Easley's
sister Katie,

"Will you be in Utah next weekend by chance??"

"By god, you bet your ass I will!"

In a wonderful stroke of serendipity Katie will be in Utah for the weekend for her
daughter Blake's volleyball tournament. Apparently Blake's team is a monster and
has a chance to make it to the national tournament based on their results from
this weekend. I just saw Katie & Blake and met Katie's kickass boyfriend Jesse
in August at the beginning of this whole unemployment sabbatical extravaganza.
While it hasn't quite been 20 years I'm still excited to see them.

My plans for my time in Utah are *fluid* so I can meet up with them easy peasy.
Bob & LaGayle warn that the ski areas tomorrow are going to be a zoo since it
will be Saturday and they got some fresh snow. The roads are sure to be
completely logjammed, which leads me to give a quick geography lesson.

<h4 class="article-subheader">The Canyons</h4>
The most iconic ski areas in the Salt Lake City area reside in *The Canyons*,
more properly Big Cottonwood Canyon and Little Cottonwood Canyon. Big Cottonwood
Canyon is home to Brighton & Solitude and Little Cottonwood Canyon boasts Alta
and Snowbird. All four are well regarded but Alta/Snowbird have a special place
in the hearts of many skiers. I say skiers because Alta is one of the few resorts
that still only allows skiers. Snowboarders not welcome.

These canyons receive legendary dumps of snow but, being canyons, don't avail
themselves to the hordes of alpine athletes who swarm the two lane roads every
winter. The demographics point to a steady increase in the number of people
living and recreating in the area, and the anecdotal evidence is stronger than
the avalanches that need to be cleared from the canyons after each big
snowstorm. To add a straw to the back of the camel who has long ago collapsed
and is gasping for air, Covid has exacerbated and accelerated the aforementioned
demographic trends.

All of that is to say that I'd be *jazzed* to ski tomorrow but it sounds like
I'd be sitting in traffic and lift lines longer than actually sliding down
a mountain. Katie texts me that they will be day drinking in Park City if I
want to join, which makes my decision easier than a "social studies" class for
an Alabama football player.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Park City</h4>
The next morning I wake up for some coffee & breakfast with Bob, LaGayle, and
the puppers. After brekky I get a quick workout in at their great home gym,
giving my upper body a bit of work after all the pounding my legs have taken on
the slopes. The rest of the morning I just putz around, actually enjoying some
time to relax & recuperate.

Serendipity strikes again when Bob & LaGayle tell me that they are planning a
trip to Park City this afternoon & offer me a ride. Anticipating my condition I
decide the most prudent course of action would be to abstain from driving so I
gladly accept their offer. We load up into Bob's Audi SUV with Pittsburgh
Steelers license plate holders and set off towards PC.

A half hour later they drop me off by the town gondola and tell me the garage
code for the house in case I arrive at an unreasonable hour. I would never.

*Narrator*: he will.

I wander around town for a bit before ducking into ___ for a beer to wait
for Katie & crew to finish up at the volleyball.

I guess this is the part of the story that I should introduce Branch. Branch is
a friend of Easley's from Boston who moved out to Utah a couple years ago but
couldn't afford a flight for his accent. He still *pahks* his *cah* in the lot
before shredding the *powdah* at *Snowbuhd*.

Branch doesn't drink beers he has *bowls of loudmouth soup*

Branch doesn't ______ he _________.

Branch calls me "Matis" because he thinks I look like Mathisyahu. He spells it
"mattis yahoo"

Branch is fantastic.

In a another example of serendipity I actually met Branch before Easley did,
when I went to Boston for a concert in college. He was a friend of a friend and
we enjoyed a bowl after bowl of loudmouth soup that weekend. A few years later
after Easley graduated college & began his life as a young professional in
Boston he became friends with Branch, completely unbeknownst of our previous
bouts of hooliganry. Serendipity indeed.

While enjoying a Powder Buoy pilsner at Collie's Sports Bar & Grill I get a text
from Branch

*We are gonna be a bit, left my wallet at the house so we've got to turn
around*

Dammit Branch. This is a man who is responsible for the health and wellbeing of
an infant. I can't believe you don't even need a permit to have a kid. Thankfully
his lovely wife Katie does yeoman's work covering for the tomfoolery of her 
husband.

We had discussed meeting up at No Name Saloon, a famous Park City watering hole
where we wasted away an afternoon last year over cold ales between great friends.
We made it back to SLC by the skin of our teeth when an epic snowstorm hit
as afternoon turned to evening.

No Name is a popular spot - at its busiest last year we took a peek out the
window and the line to get in was probably 50 people long - so I decide to go
check it out before everyone else arrives to see how mobbed it is. To my
delight there's no line, plus the bouncer is a Bills fan so we spend 5 minutes
talking ball. I post up at the bar and order myself a Johnny's American IPA from
Moab Brewery to wait for the crew. Before I finish my pint I see Katie, Jesse
and a couple other volleyball parents darken the door of the No Name Saloon.

Bear hugs are shared all around despite the fact that it's only been about 6
months since we last saw each other. We enjoy
a few rounds at No Name then meet Branch at Flanagan's Irish Pub & Restaurant
since No Name disallows children. We enjoy a few more rounds of ales and a
hearty supper before loading up and heading back down I-80 to SLC. I bum a ride
with Branch & family and just like clockwork the snow starts to dump right as
we're leaving town because I can't just ride from Park City to Salt Lake on
clear roads. Branch handles the snow with all the dexterity of a Masshole and
I make it back to Bob & LaGayle's safe & sound. Let's get back to the slopes
tomorrow.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Deer Valley</h4>
Today it's back to Park City to Deer Valley, a fancy ski resort that is
famous for its groomers. We skied it last year and it wasn't the most
challenging skiing but we had a good time cruising around nonetheless. Around
lunchtime that day we stoped off at a bar on the mountain for some refreshments.
Seeing as it was our last day skiing on the trip we decided to treat ourselves
to some bubbly & splurged on a $150 bottle of Veuve Cliquot to split 5 ways. To
perfectly encapsulate the fanciness level of this place they were sold out of
the Veuve. Incredible. So we decided on a bottle for half the price, which was
so nice we ordered it twice.

There are no $150 bottles of champagne in my future, however a bowl of turkey
chili sure is. LaGayle told me as I left the house this morning that I needed
to get the turkey chili while I'm at Deer Valley, it's the best meal she's
ever had on a ski mountain.

The thing about a fancy ski hill is that it attracts a lot of rich assholes who
wouldn't know proper skiing technique from a hole in the ground. They slosh
snow around like pontoon boats on the 4th of July, they clog up the runs
like idiots, and overall ruin
the vibe. But if I skied any other resort on my Ikon pass I'd have to deal with
the traffic nightmare that is canyon roads after a fresh snow. Like most things
in life it's all about tradeoffs.

My first few runs are spent weaving through fluffy mounds of snow scraped down
to the ice by jackasses who would think you're talking about a turkey if you
asked about carving. And then dodging the jackasses themselves - on my third run
while cruising down an easy blue run some jackwagon comes from behind me
and skis over the back of my planks, causing me to go ass-over-teakettle. The
landing was soft and I wasn't traveling to swiftly but I yelled at the prick
nonetheless. Rich ski assholes. Can't stand em.

My day improves on the lift ride up when a fella by the name of Jacob offers me
a nip of bourbon. He's not one of the rich assholes. Jacob is a real one. I
spend the early part of the morning taking some runs off the Sultan Express lift,
which has some good runs but they are tracked out pretty bad. I scoot across
the mountain to the Lady Morgan area where I finally find some good snow. It's
slightly far afield and most of the runs over here are more advanced so it keeps
the riff-raff away. Which is fine by me because the Lady Morgan Bowl is
easily the best skiing on the mountain. I take a few spins over here before
my lunch date with a bowl of turkey chili. After one bite I realize that LaGayle
knows what she's talking about. This is absolutely delicious. I warsh it down
with a Pale Ale from UTOG Brewing Co. out of Ogden, UT.

After lunch I cruise around Flagstaff Mountain, the biggest section of the
mountain I haven't been to yet. Some nice, easy runs here before heading back
to the Sultan for a few leg burners and before I know it the day is over.
