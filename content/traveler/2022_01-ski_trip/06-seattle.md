<p style="font-size: 1.5em;"><b>Seconds</b></p>

Pardon my French, but I'm a grown man and don't need some silly little code word
to say *are you fucking kidding me???* Josh Allen put the team, nay
the entirety of Western New York, on his back at Arrowhead Stadium in a
performance that would make a Marvel superhero look like Barney Fife. It was
one of the most remarkable individual performances under the brightest of lights.
They always say if you want to be the best you have to beat the best. Ever since
Patrick Mahomes burst onto the scene with his MVP 2018 campaign, his Kansas
City Chiefs have been the gold standard of the NFL. Tonight Big Josh went
toe to toe with Mahomes and proved that he's among the NFL's elite.

His 17-play 75-yard touchdown drive in the 4th quarter was a thing of beauty.
Josh burned 7 minutes off the clock with 5 3rd-down and two 4th-down
conversions, the last of which was a missile to a wide open Gabriel Davis in the
back of the endzone on 4th &
13. The two point conversion to Stefon Diggs puts the Bills up 3
with 1:54 left

<p class="fs-6"><b><i>"Too much time"</i></b></p>

Like a heavyweight battle between two behemoths, Mahomes had a counterpunch to
Josh's big right hand. The Chiefs answered with a touchdown drive of their own,
leaving the Bills down 4 with 62 seconds and 3 timeouts at their disposal.

<p class="fs-6"><b><i>"Too much time"</i></b></p>

Josh only needed 49 of those seconds, firing another rocket to Gabe Davis for
his *fourth* touchdown catch of the night, setting a new NFL record for TD grabs
in a playoff game. His 201 yards receiving slot him in at 9th for most
receiving yards in an NFL playoff game, a list that is topped by Eric Moulds's
240 yard performance for the Bills against Miami in the AFC Wild Card round in
1999.

The instant Davis hauls in Josh's missile over the middle for the go-ahead
score, the Seattle Bills Backers erupts in a tsunami of euphoria. It's absolute
pandemonium. Greg & Joanne do a quick check on Super Bowl tickets. My stress
drinking turns to celebratory drinking.

And thus brings us to the 13 seconds.

All the Bills need to do is hold on for 13 more seconds. ***13 seconds***. In a
complete breakdown of coaching the Bills somehow manage to let the Chiefs drive
44 yards for the game tying field goal to send the game to overtime. Each and
every decision the Bills coaching staff made was the wrong one. Any single
correct decision and the Bills would be hosting the AFC Championship
game. Just one. Squib kick it. Don't protect the sidelines when the Chiefs have
3 timeouts. Maybe cover Travis Kelce. Or at least get a jam on him at the line.
Fucking *anything*.

It was hard to watch.

The day started in Portland, Landon already well on his way to Tulsa. Mikey
& I grab a quick bite at the hotel before heading North on Interstate 5. The
drive *can* be quite scenic, unfortunately the entirety of the journey is
shrouded in a dense fog. No Mt St Helens. No Mt Adams. No Mt Ranier. We can't
even see the skyline of Seattle as we pull into town.

The Pacific Northwest is notoriously dreary, however we are in the midst of a
particularly drab meterological phenomenon. The haze initially developed as
radiation fog, where clear skies allow heat to escape into space, cooling the
surface air & dropping it below the dew point. The fog is lingering due
to Seattle's geography, sitting in a valley between the Olympic & Cascade
mountain ranges. The foggy duvet is being held in place by a layer of
high pressure air acting like a lid on a jar. The fog is expected to linger
through Friday - 4 more days of obscurity before it clears to make
way for a more familiar Seattle weather pattern: rain.

Just have a look at this cartoon.

The melancholic weather perfectly suits our mood as we return to Joanne's house
after the Bills game. We cope the only way we know how: drinking in the hot tub.

If this were a movie, this is the point where we'd cut to me, lying
on the bathroom floor in a wet, soapy heap all tangled up in a shower curtain.
I would then turn to the camera and say something along the lines of, "I bet
you're wondering how I got here." Then we'd play in reverse the scene of me
tumbling out of the shower, tearing the shower curtain liner out in the
process.

Apparently my brain thought the shower tub was wider than it actually was, my
spatial awareness woefully impaired as it were. I took a
step to the side and *bam* my foot hit the wall of the tub, all my momentum
headed for the diaphanous facade of the shower curtain. The fall happened in slow
motion, a rush of terror washing over me. A helpless feeling of panic looking
for something, anything to grab onto. *Oh dear god please don't rip the
curtain rod out of the wall*. Luckily Greg & Joanne
are classy & have the type of shower curtain liner that snaps into place for
ease of removal & cleaning. It surely doesn't have "tearaway" in the list of
benefits on the package but in my opinion it should.

Joanne texts to ask if I'm ok. I assure her that I am, nothing hurt other than
my pride.

To be fair I almost did the exact same thing a couple days later stone cold
sober. **Is that tub regulation size or what??**

Well if you can imagine the combination of 3 hours of stress drinking followed by
anger drinking in a hot tub and a bathroom tumble makes for a rough Monday. I'm
pretty sure I didn't leave the house for two days.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Back to the Slopes</h4>
On Wednesday I muster the energy to engage in some recreation. As part of my
Ikon ski pass I have the opportunity to take advantage of their "First Tracks"
promotion. Once a month Ikon pass holders are allowed access to the slopes an
hour before the general public. Ideally this would occur on a powder day, but
today I have no such luck.

I hit the road bright & early, out the door with enough time for the 2 hour
drive for my
7:30 check-in. I could seriously use a cup o' joe at this hour & I whiz past a
drive-thru coffee hut before I can even hit the brakes. These little coffee
stands are a common occurrence in the PNW, typically situated at the edge of a
parking lot, no bigger than a walk-in closet. Determined to not buzz past the
next coffee shop, I consult Google Maps, who shows me there is a joint called
"Cowgirl Espresso" about 5 miles up the road. The name seems a bit odd, maybe
it's just a Western themed coffee outfit. Whatever, I'm always down to support
women owned businesses.

I turn off the highway into a muddy patch of desolate highway frontage with a
few big rigs sprawled about. It feels eerily uncomfortable but at this point I
just need a coffee. I pull up to the java shack & I am immediately
startled by the sight of
a woman in a skimpy string bikini stepping to the window. It's 15 degrees
outside. Now all the semi trucks parked here make sense. Pervs.

I order a coffee & she makes conversation like nothing is amiss. She notices my
Bills hat & comments how upset she was that they lost. I string together a few
words, still flabbergasted at the situation. The coffee is,
predictably, terrible. I pull back out onto the highway, eager to get to the
mountain and put that nightmare behind me.

I arrive at Crystal Mountain at half past 7 & waddle up to the gondola to check
in. After checking in I realize that I inadvertently set my skis at the front of
the gondola line. I look at the two guys who *were* at the front of the line.

"Ahhh shit, my bad I didn't realize this was the front of the line"

"Ehhh It's no problem, are you from out of town?"

"Yeah I'm from Oklahoma"

"Well shit yeah stay right there you can ride up with us if you want"

And that's how I met Jeff & Eric.

Jeff is a character, boisterous in a *fun uncle* kind of way. He's loud, he's
jovial, and he's not afraid to talk to anyone. Every 5-10 minutes he'll
spontaneously break into his mating call.

**"Wooooo!!!! Wolf Pack!! Wolf Pack baby!!!"**

Am I part of the wolf pack? Is there some sort of initiation? Are you ok, Jeff?

Eric is a bit quieter, content to let Jeff do all the talking. They both work
for Boeing & are able to take a few mid-week mornings off per month to embrace
the send. Sounds like a hell of a gig to me.

<div id="thermos"></div>

Before we hop on the gondola, the liftie tells us the first 25 people to make
a purchase at the Summit House Restaurant at the top of the gondola will receive a
free Stanley thermos. Well you would have thought Jeff won the lottery with that
news.

**"A free Stanley thermos?? Ohhhhh heck yeah, I love those things! You hear that
Eric? A free Stanley thermos.. We'll get a shot of Fireball & a free Stanley
thermos. Can you believe that? A free Stanley thermos!!"**

Yep a free\* Stanley thermos.

\*price of a shot of Fireball whiskey.

We load up on the gondola and I give them my spiel. I call it my "chairlift
pitch," the skiing version of an elevator pitch. It's met with
amazement, thinly veiled envy, and leading questions about my favorite mountain
in the hopes that I say it's theirs. Jeff is interested in my story like a dog
with a bone. He can't get enough of it.

**"Well before you leave you need to get a beer at the Snorting Elk, it's been
voted the best apr&egrave;s bar in the country. It's like being in a Swiss chalet,
it's really great. Eric & I will be down there around 1 today if you want to
join us.**

**......**

**Ha! A free Stanley thermos!! Can you believe it!!""**

The gondola reaches the top & we scurry into the
Summit House for our **free Stanley thermos**. We throw back a round of Fireball
whiskeys & snag our thermos from the bewildered looking girl at the register. I
don't think they told her about the thermos promo.

Our whistles wetted, we gear up & head for the Green Valley Express, the only lift that
will be open for the first tracks program. The corduroy is fresh and we rip it
up. High speed carving
on a relatively empty piste. It's not the most challenging but it is definitely
fun, lap after lap.

Eventually the rest of the mountain opens & we venture out to other areas.
I follow the fellas around a few runs, accidentally losing them on a run after
dipping into the trees to take a leak. No matter, they've
shown me a good portion of the mountain and explained all the best areas so I'm
good on my own.

I head back up to the top of the gondola to enjoy the scenery. It's a bluebird
day, a start contrast to the thick fog still smothering Seattle. In fact, I can
see the fog in the distance, a seeming lake between the mountains. Poor bastards.
The ski area is in the shadow of Mt Ranier, with Mt Adams & Mt St Helens in
plain view as well.

</figure>

I spend the rest of the day meandering here & there, wishing the snow was better.
One lift in particular looks like it accesses some awesome terrain, which is
unfortunately closed today due to the less than ideal conditions. They aren't
terrible, just a bit crusty off the groomers.

Just after 1 PM I finish the day at the Snorting Elk with a Woodpile IPA from
Stoup Brewing and
a bowl of chili. I pop open my ski tracks app to see the damage I did today &
I'm amazed to see I skied 33,650' vertical on 23 runs, my biggest day
since I started tracking last season. Not too shabby.

I finish up at the Snorting Elk & lug my gear back to the car. The two hour
drive back to Greg & Joanne's does not feature any scantily clad women, for
better or worse. I worked up a hell of an appetite today, which is fortunate
seeing that today is Raclette Day. Michael, for all his world travels, has never
dined at a
<a href="/traveler/2021_04-ski_trip/wp/day_10.html?id=raclette" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raclette table</a>,
a fact that we plan to remedy tonight.

But not before a plop in Greg & Joanne's hot tub to soothe my sore muscles.
While I soak, Greg is busy in the kitchen prepping for supper. Michael insists
that we blanch the broccoli
& Brussels sprouts because texture.. or something... I wasn't listening my
stomach was rumbling too loud.

Greg gets the table all heated up and Joanne is able to peel away from her boss
Gail's relentless messages long enough for some DIY dinner.

As expected the the vittles are outstanding. The meat is marinated to perfection,
the veggies are.. blanched to perfection. Chef Michael is impressed with the
Raclette table & we spend the night cooking, tasting, drinking red wine.

</figure>

This is Michael's last night here but not his last night *here*. His cousin
Heather, who hosted us last week in San Francisco, is headed up to Seattle
tomorrow for some vacay time with her folks, who are coming in from Chicago.
He will be staying with them through the weekend at their Airbnb near Ballard,
an area on the Sound with a plethora of breweries. No way we give that
neighborhood a visit.

<p class="section-divider my-4">&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;</p>

The next morning I gear up and head to Alpental, one of four ski areas that
make up The Summit at Snoqualmie, the closest ski resort to Seattle, about
an hour East on I-90. Just as the weathermen predicted, the blanket of fog has
burned off, exposing bright blue skies for
my drive. Well most of my drive. As I pull into the parking lot I
look up to the mountain and see a cloud of fog so thick I can't even see the
lodge. Well shit. I debate just heading back, but seeing as I've already driven
up here I might as well take a few spins.

I strap on the gear and hit the lift. About 2/3rds of the way up the fog clears
and we're back to blue skies again. I soon find myself dealing with a
Neapolitan layered weather situation, perfect clear skies at top, horrible
can't-see-shit fog mid-mountain, and more moderate I-can-ski-through-this fog on
the lower third.

They only have one lift running today, which is a shame because the upper
mountain area looks like it has some decent terrain. As it stands I just lap the
one lift a handful of times and call it a day. 5 runs, 6,000 feet of vertical,
51 minutes. I spend twice as much time in the car as I do on the slopes.

Oh well, that's just the way she goes sometimes. Plus I have plenty of skiing
left on this trip, I'm not too worried about it.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Weekend Warriors</h4>
I head back to the house and enjoy the last few hours of sunshine strolling
around Kirkland with Michael. We walk through a few parks that front Lake
Washington, with beautiful views of Mt Ranier, the Seattle skyline, and the
Olympic mountain range.

Greg & Joanne have booked us a reservation tonight at Flatstick Pub, the new
indoor putt-putt bar in town. We get to the pub and the gang's all here,
Greg & Joanne, Michael, Heather, and her folks Joe & Darlene. We enjoy a few
ales and a few tales before grabbing our sticks. Much like any mini-golf track,
many of the holes have a choice: you can go for the "hero" shot or play it safe. I
bet you can guess which choice I took. Every time. To disastrous results. At
least we met an awesome dog named Copper who had no conception of the
tidal wave of embarrassment that washes over you when you write a "10" on your
putt-putt scorecard.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Copper chillin' on the 8 tee box</figcaption>
</figure>

Greg is a pro and smokes everybody handily. We enjoy another round of brewskis
before Heather & her folks call it a night and head for their Airbnb, Michael in
tow. We amble back up to the house and call it a night ourselves.

I spend the next morning chilling at a coffee shop in town, resting my ski legs.
This evening I have plans to meet for happy hour with my friend Anne, a friend
from Houston who currently lives in Seattle. She suggests a spot for libations in
the Capitol Hill area of town called Linda's Tavern. I check the transit options
because when you're
in the big city you do big city things. Plus, given my propensity to cave to
barroom peer pressure, it's best that I don't drive.

I stroll down to the Kirkland Transit Center, conveniently located adjacent to
the main drag, where I hop on the route 255 bus headed for Seattle. I jump off
at the light rail station on the UW campus, where I notice a
peculiarly large group of able bodied folks piling on the elevator. I soon find
out why. To get to the train platform you need to take three long
escalators to the preposterous depth of 100 feet below the surface. For
perspective, this would tie for third deepest out of NYC's 472 subway stations.

The Central Puget Sound Regional Transit authority is
currently working through
designs to build 62 miles of new light rail in Seattle, the fastest growing
transit market in the US. The proposed depth of the downtown stations? 140 feet.
As of writing,
<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/rolling-in-the-deep-sound-transit-riders-would-descend-nine-levels-downtown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an
article</a>
on The Seattle Times website detailing the plans has 228 comments. People are
worked up about their subterranean labyrinthine future.

Anyway, I finally make it to the platform, which is so clean that it would make
Michael uncomfortable, having spent the last decade-plus riding the NYC subway.
I'm only on the train one stop, where I disembark at the
Capitol Hill station. I later learn that this was the birthplace of grunge and
you can feel it. The 'hood has retained a gritty vibe, unpolished by the
sterile monotony that afflicts many contemporary urban neighborhoods. The
streets are dotted with dive bars, live music venues, and graffiti. This isn't
to say there hasn't been change - the list of online articles lamenting the
closing of any number of neighborhood
haunts is long - however the area has retained at least a modicum of the grungy
angst that made it the preferred home for Cobain, Cornell, Vedder, and
Staley.

I pop into Linda's, one of the aforementioned dives. The wooden back bar sports
a wall of bottles afore a mirror that likely hasn't been cleaned
since the 90s, all below a taxidermied bison head. Anne arrives right after me and
we make our way to the back patio to enjoy the unseasonably favorable
weather. We are soon joined by two of her Amazon co-workers and their wives, who
immediately start scrolling through their phones any time the Amazoners start
talking shop.

<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/sea_lindas.jpg" alt="Lindas">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">My kinda place</figcaption>
</figure>

We enjoy a few rounds of suds on the patio before the others have to bail. Anne
and I continue the merrymaking at Bait Shop, a nautical themed dive with tropical
drinks. After a couple seafaring cold ones we head for a nightcap at Boca, an
Argentinian restaurant a few doors down. The place is decorated with
Argentinian mementos, soccer memorabilia, and of course a shrine to Maradona,
Messi, and Jesus Christ above the bar.

While we were in
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/02-cali.html#tahoe-friday" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tahoe</a>
I discovered that in addition to crazy fact that San Francisco accounts for 25%
of fernet's domestic market share, Argentina accounts for a mind boggling 75%
international market share. It's so ubiquitous in Argentina that the fernet &
coke has been described as the country's unofficial drink. Naturally, I order
a fernie cola. *When in Buenos Aires*.

Now I'm pretty open when it comes to food & drink, I'll try anything and there
are few things that I categorically detest. Fernie & coke is one of them. I just
can't fathom how anybody would enjoy this vile concoction. I manage to choke
down the swill and we call it a night. We say our goodbyes and I opt for an Uber
back to Kirkland.

The next day we have plans to check out Ballard, the neighborhood by the Sound
where Michael & Heather are staying. The area is riddled with breweries - there
are 16 breweries or taprooms within a short walk of each other. I can certainly
get on board with that.

I start the day with a quick run around the neighborhood to sweat out the
toxins. I follow an old railroad line for a few miles, around the periphery of
Juanita Beach Park, and back up set of stairs in the forest that never seems to
end.

<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/sea_stairs.JPEG" alt="Stairs">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Stairway to Kirkland</figcaption>
</figure>

I get cleaned up and we set our course for Ballard, Seattle's brewery mecca. On
the way we stop at the Fremont Troll, a 20 foot high concrete public art project
built in 1990. Joanne and I snap a few photos, while being photobombed by a
young girl climbing on the statue. I actually spend more time admiring the 170
foot high cantilever truss bridge above the troll if you can believe that.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">You gotta pay the troll toll</figcaption>
</figure>

On our way back to the car we stroll past a bronze statue of Vladimir Ilyich
Ulyanov. A man perhaps better known as Lenin.

<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/sea_lenin.JPEG" alt="Lenin">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">I am the walrus</figcaption>
</figure>

Well now I have to find out how the hell this got here. It was discovered in a
Czechoslovakian scrapyard by a Seattle native teaching English overseas named
Lewis E. Carpenter. Mr Carpenter found the hollow statue
with a homeless man living inside it, a felicitous allegory for Soviet
Communism.

LEC had to work some bureaucratic magic to obtain approval to buy and move the
statue out of the country. Once the proper wheels had been greased, it was
chopped into three pieces, overlanded
to Rotterdam, then shipped to the US. The statue eventually arrived in Seattle,
where Carpenter planned to install it in front of his Slovak restaurant to
draw business.

That was August 1993. Carpenter died in a car accident in February 1994.

The statue has been sitting at the corner of Fremont Place and North 36th
Street ever since, waiting for a buyer. It can be yours for $250,000.

It seems fitting for a neighborhood whose motto is *Libertas Quirkas* -
freedom to be peculiar. Seattle is wild.

We depart Fremont for the quick drive to Michael & Heather's Airbnb in Ballard.
We see Michael wearily ramble out of the house & tell us that he'll be the only
one joining us for the brewery tour. Apparently they got into the wine last
night and everyone is worse for wear. But Michael, being the trooper that he is,
saddles up anyway. Good man.

We stop off first at Stoup Brewing, an outfit that I am familiar with from my
apr&egrave;s IPA at the Snorting Elk. I order myself a flight spanning the
spectrum from pilsner to stout. Each offering tickles my taste buds in just the
right way. They do good work here. After I down the flight I decide on a pint of
the Mosaic Pale Ale to enjoy with our food truck nachos.

<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/sea_stoup.jpeg" alt="Stoup">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Not only is the beer delicious they have a bridge in their logo!</figcaption>
</figure>

After Stoup we wander down to Obec Brewing, where I order a Not Dead Yet IPA.
This one doesn't dazzle me the way the brews at Stoup did. It's not *bad*,
however this particular
tipple just doesn't suit my fancy. We dump down our beers and spill back out
into the industrial brewery-ridden avenues.

As we wander around our stomachs start to grumble. All this drinking can really
work up an appetite & the nachos are starting to wear off. Looking for a bite to
eat, we stumble into the Walrus and the Carpenter, an
appellative homage to Lewis Carroll's *Through the Looking-Glass*. This appears
to be the place to be on a Saturday in Ballard, with a 2 hour wait for the dining
room. As luck would have it, a table at the bar opens up just as we arrive.
Since the eponymous characters in Carroll's poem eat oysters we decide
to enjoy a few mollusks at the bar before a proper supper. We'll just ape John
Lennon & pretend we don't know the Walrus & Carpenter are the villains of the
story.

Joanne & Greg don't eat oysters so Michael and I order a dozen for just the two
of us, chef's choice.
They are all freshly caught in Washington, and they are delightful. The Chelsea
Gems in particular are outstanding. So outstanding that Michael and I order a
second dozen of just the Gems. My god what a gustatory treasure these little
babies are.

We finish up our oyster feast and walk down the street to Ballard Pizza Company
for a few pies and suds. At this point in the night our eyelids are starting to
get heavy. We've had quite the day and it's about time to put it to rest.

We say our goodbyes to Michael, who will be heading back to Brooklyn in the
morning. He has been my trusty travel companion for the past two weeks, through
3 states & 1,100 miles. That's equivalent to the drive from Buffalo to Tulsa.
Love ya, cuz.

With Mikey Bob back on the East Coast, Sunday finds us in Woodinville, a town
just a bit North of Kirkland with over
100 wine tasting rooms. Greg & Joanne are members at Chateau Ste. Michelle,
which seems to be so popular nobody goes there anymore. So we instead head to
the J. Bookwalter Tasting Studio. The Bengals-Chiefs AFC
Championship game is on in the corner and I sit with my back to it. I can't even
bring myself to watch the game that should have been in Orchard Park.

We are greeted by a friendly sommelier/waiter/salesman, coincidentally also named
Mike. Mike pours us our wines and waxes poetic about the superiority of J.
Bookwalter wines to all other Washington wines. Having yet to taste all other
Washington wines all I can say is that J. Bookwalter squeezes a fine grape. The
glint in Mike's eye shines bright like a diamond when we voice satisfaction with
their viticultures. He immediately breaks into the full court press, pushing
Joanne and Greg to buy a bottle from their premium collection. They don't cave
to his pressure and buy a couple more moderately priced offerings, which seemed
perfectly adequate to me.

When we ask Mike for recommendations of other tasting rooms, you can almost hear
the visceral pain jangle through his body. He can
rattle off dozens of rooms we should avoid and can only offer the most meager of
praise to a handful of wineries. When we tell him we'll just head across the
street to Guardian Cellars he winces like he's getting a tooth pulled. Whatever
Mike, we'll do what we want.

We venture across the street to Guardian, a tasting room with a chic, modern
feel adorned with posh couches for casual lounging. A much more relaxed vibe.
Our waitress Candace comes around to explain their wines, all of which come from
the Tri-Cities area in Eastern Washington.

Which brings me to another pointless digression.

I have a minor linguistic quibble with the term "Tri-Cities". The
largest city of the triumvirate just barely tops 70,000, which doesn't scream
"city" to me. The US Census defines an *Urbanized Area* as a "a continuously
built-up area with a population of 50,000 or more," while the OECD defines a
*small urban area* as a municipality with between 50,000 and 200,000 residents.

If you want to call a *small urban area* a city, by all means go right ahead.
But I doubt you'll find a building over 30 stories tall in a polity of 70,000
souls, which I'll just
arbitrarily throw out there as my definition of a city. The Tri-Cities could go
the alliterative route and call themselves the *Tri-Towns*. Or the
*Triple-Hamlets.* Or the *Trigonous-Villages.*
Or the *Tripartite Alliance of Small Urban Areas* if you're not into brevity.

So the wines come from the Tri-Cities area, which sits in the region of the
Columbia, Yakima, and Walla Walla valleys. I'm familiar with Walla Walla
because that's where Drew Bledsoe hails from & where he makes, from what I've
heard, great wine. We really squandered a golden opportunity last week because
I'm just now seeing that he has a tasting room in Bend. A real Bend blunder.

Jesus, I can't stay on track. Ok we're at Guardian Cellars. These wines are
much more playful & funky. Their insouciant approach to winemaking pleases me;
it's more in line with
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/03-wine.html?id=tank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tank Garage Winery</a>
than the snobs over at J. Bookwalter.

Joanne & Greg make it evident that they are actually interested in the
Bengals-Chiefs game so I pull it up on my phone. We tune in just in time to
watch Joey Burrah work his 4th quarter & OT magic to vanquish the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nmgice3ieZ4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chefs</a> and punch their
ticket to their first Super Bowl since another Joey led the '9ers to victory
with the help of a 11 grab 215 yard day from MVP Jerry Lee Rice. Great
googly moogly!

Candace continues to pour us more wines but all I can think is *Big Josh would
have beat the Bengals*. Ugh.

We settle up at Guardian and saunter back to the Jeep. It's been a nice little
Sunday of good wine & great company. But I'm ready to hit the slopes again.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Baker Beckons</h4>
When I made my PNW trek last spring, the only mountain still open that late in
the season in all of Washington state was
<a href="/traveler/2021_04-ski_trip/wp/day_10.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mt. Baker</a>.
Which makes perfect sense, given that its 641 average annual
inches of snowfall is one of the highest in the world. It also holds the
distinction of snowiest season ever recorded anywhere on Earth at 1,140 inches -
that's *95 feet* of snow in one season. Outrageous.

The skiing last year was tremendous, and while not on my Ikon pass, I *must* go
back. Luckily it's more remote, less developed, and more moderately priced
than some of the resorts that charge $200+ for a day of skiing. It's so old
school the only place you can buy a lift ticket is at the window. None of this
fancy online shit. I love it.

And the terrain is terrific. The two lifts up the left side serve some nice
cruisy blues, while the hill on the right has some hard chargin' leg burners.
And the backcountry looks incredible.

</figure>

It's a bit of a haul to Baker, about 2.5 hours NNE up near the Canadian border.
The last 20 minutes I wind through a marvelous forest of snow covered trees that
look like they've been individually decorated with frosting. I wish someone else
were driving so I could enjoy the view. I pull into the White Salmon Lodge
parking lot just after 11 & head for the left side for a couple warm up runs.

Today will be my first day of fresh snow - only about
3-4 inches - but I'll take it. Seeing as I am nowhere near the first to the
mountain today (given the brewery tour & wine tastings this weekend) the snow
has been skied out quite a bit. I am, however, able to find some sweet, sweet
pockets of delicious untouched powder. The effortless feeling of floating
through fresh snow is divine. It's shin deep in some places.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">The power of pow</figcaption>
</figure>

After a couple warm ups, I head over to the more challenging right side of the
mountain. Given the type of skier that frequents Mt. Baker, it's substantially
more carved up than the other side. I shred my legs for a couple runs over here
& decide to head back over to the gentler slopes to work on my powder turns in
some better snow.

Halfway down the very first run back on the easy side I get lazy on a turn and
catch the inside of my right ski in the pow. It yanks my foot back & I take a
tumble, which is actually quite fun on a powder day. But as I stand up I realize
I've tweaked something in my hip. I didn't tear anything but it's just a little
tender to put weight on and more painful when I do certain movements. Sunofabitch.

I'm able to cruise down to the lodge no problem, where I decide to grab lunch &
see if it feels better after a little rest. After about an hour and a PB&J for
strength I decide to call it a day. It's not too painful, there are just some
angles where it's weak and I don't want to injure myself worse. It's a bummer
but no sense risking it.

You win this time, Baker.

It's a sad slog back to the car after only a couple hours of skiing on my first
powder day of the season. Bummer. I make the drive back through the Bob Ross
forest of happy trees and stop off at North Fork Brewery for a lugubrious ale. I
order a flight & slice of pep that lifts my beleaguered spirits. Then back on
the road to Seattle.

<h4 class="article-subheader" id="laura">You Won't Believe This... But I Have Another
Cousin Coming to Visit</h4>
Yep. Cousins galore. If you can't keep it all straight, don't worry about it,
neither can my brothers.

My cousin Laura is on her way from Buffalo to hang with us in the great Pacific
Northwest. Laura and I are pretty close, she 5 days older than me after all. She
was my
<a href="/traveler/2021_11-nyc_marathon.html?id=logistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marathon sherpa</a>
last November in the Big Apple. She brought my Australian bush hat all the way
back to the States after the dumb brain that ostensibly should have been under
said hat left it at a hotel in Perth. Laura is a treasure.

Growing up every time I'd talk with my Grandpa Skip on the phone he'd ask me how
my grades were. More times than not he'd interrupt me to tell me Laura got
straight-A's. She always got straight-A's. And my grandpa loved rubbing it in my
face. Not a chance that emotional trauma scarred me as a child and has anything
to do with my current nomadic vagabondage. No way. Also can you clean tears out
of a keyboard? Asking for a friend.

Laura's arrives at SEATAC just before 11 and I scoop her up, headed for Victrola
Coffee Roasters, a spot in Capitol Hill that was recommended by my good friend
Cameron. We properly
caffeinate ourselves before a little neighborhood wanderin'. Our first stop is
a quirky boutique called Standard Goods that has eclectic bags, stickers, mugs,
and postcards, alongside an assortment of PNW themed threads. I find a kickass
flannel shirt and an impossibly soft cardigan for my mom, whose sole criteria
when purchasing clothing is "is it soft?"

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Got everything we need here</figcaption>

Laura barters for a few wares of her own and we continue our jaunt. We're
walking down a random street when all of a sudden I hear Laura exclaim, "Oh my
god!! They have a Glossier here!!"

"A.. uh what?"

"Don't worry about it, can you give me about 10 minutes?"

"Yeah sure, I have nowhere to be"

We dip into Glossier and it appears to be a makeup store? Skin creams &
lipsticks & nail polishes galore. According to Laura,
they have been exclusively online and just recently opened a few stores. Of all
the skin joints in all the cities in all the world we stumble onto this
one. I pop a squat on an artsy bench-couch situation that, if it's not called
"The Man Corner" it surely has some such similar sobriquet.

A woman comes to help Laura and gives me a knowing nod on the Ottoman du
Gentleman. I non-sardonically implore her to take all the time she wants, I
really am in no rush. No I mean it. I'm serious. No joke.

Laura does whatever it is you do at a Glossier shop and seems to be really
enjoying it. Perhaps we should change the phrase "kid in a candy store" to
"adult woman in a Glossier store." I suppose "adult man mouthbreathingly
staring at an electronic slab displaying modern gladiatorial combat" would do
just the same.

I take a look at the Glossier website and right on the front page, in big
bold letters it reads,

**I want to smell like this forever**

Now I really regret calling this place a skin joint.

Laura's Glossier craving now satiated, we continue our ramble. We stop at a
Mexican restaurant called Poquito's for a margarita in their makeshift Covid
sidewalk lean-to. I don't normally enjoy margaritas in 40 degree overcast
weather but my goodness does it hit the spot. A top notch tipple.

After our round of margs we venture back to the car & head for Kirkland. Laura
drops her luggage before we saddle up for the quick walk to town for supper. On
the way we pass a house with a ferocious guard dog that yaps at all passersby 
that dare cross his domain. We name him Colonel Cornelius Wadsworth Longstockings
III.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Why, there's Col. Cornelius standing guard. A frightening creature, indeed!</figcaption>
</figure>

Jo made us a reservation at a French brasserie called Feast. We split a bottle
of wine and some seared scallops, one of my favorite aquatic treats. To my
great chagrin, the bivalve mollusks are just ok; but my grilled Pacific halibut
& sweet potato puree is positively dynamite.

After supper, we head back to the house for a nightcap & hit the sack. Laura's
had a big day of traveling and the jet lag has her circadian rhythm all out of
sorts.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Weekend Warriors, Part Deux: Electric Boogaloo</h4>
I wake up on Friday, *very* excited about the night's plans. We have tickets to
see one of my favorite
bands, the Delvon Lamarr Organ Trio, who are based out of Seattle.
According to the band's website they are "a soul-jazz concoction that goes
straight to your heart and head makes your body break out in a sweat. Live, the
band’s fiery and intuitive chemistry is unstoppable, brimming with
improvisation, instant composition, imaginative takes on classic tunes, and a
booty-shaking back catalog of soulful gems."

I have yet to see them live and I am ready to shake my booty. I'm giddy.

<figcaption class="figure-caption mb-3">Jump to 6:15 to see my man Jimmy James
wailing on the guitar.</figcaption>

Anticipating our future condition we eschew the car and opt for
transit. The show is at the Crocodile, a venue that has been a staple of the
Seattle live music scene since it opened in 1991. It's in the Belltown
neighborhood of Seattle, which just so happens to be right next to Capitol Hill.
Since we liked Capitol Hill so much during our frolickin' yesterday we decide
to head there.

Our first stop is a real hole in the wall called the Comet Tavern. We walked
past it yesterday & knew that we needed to return - Laura shares the same
affinity for dive bars as I. We walk in and find ourselves treated to an
absolute gem. The bar features wooden booths set below
exposed brick walls and heaving wooden beams, vintage beer signs, and dollar
bills hanging from the ceiling. Pinball and billiards tables dot the joint for
those interested in a little barroom sporting, and a pull tab machine for those
interested in a little barroom gambling. But the pi&egrave;ce de
r&eacute;sistance has to be the phenomenal gabled wooden mid-Century back bar,
appointed with a built-in mirror behind bottles of cheap booze. It has to be
at least 30 feet long, all one piece. I can't imagine having to move that thing.

The bartender says it dates from the '50s & was brought in when they renovated
the place a few years back. Before the reno, the entire bar was covered
wall-to-wall in a thick patina of graffiti. There are a few panels of
graffiti-plastered walls that remain sprinkled throughout the establishment.
During Prohibition, the basement was used to smuggle liquor through a series of
tunnels. And how could you forget about Ethel O'Hearn, the unofficial patron
saint of the bar. Ethel was a chain-smoking old woman who tended bar at the
Comet for over 40 years and didn't take no crap from nobody. She's a part of the
bar. Literally. Her ashes are inside the barstool at the end of the bar, marked
with a brass plaque bearing her name.

I love this place.

<a href="/traveler/2021_04-ski_trip/wp/day_9.html?id=holy-mountain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holy Mountain Brewing Company</a>, a brewery I patronized last year with
Greg & Joanne. As expected from my experience with Holy Mountain the suds are
excellent. Laura and I enjoy our cold cruisers and meander around to further
bask in the glorious milieu of the Comet. On one wall hangs an enormous red
illuminated "C" - the
"C" from the famous Pike Place Market sign that stood from 1938-1998 before
being replaced. A long time bar patron won it in a poetry contest the market
held when tearing down the old sign. This place.

As Laura and I grudgingly acknowledge our time at the Comet is running short, we
ask the bartender for some recommendations of places to hit before the show. He
rattles off a few spots & we decide on the tiki bar, called Inside Passage. On
our way, we saunter right past a place called La Josie & we both look at each
other & know that we have to duck in. Everyone in the family's nickname for
Joanne is Josie so we couldn't *not* get a drink here.

Laura and I belly up to the bar and she immediately spots her swill of choice.
$10 for a shot of Hornitos and a tallboy Modelo. Damn good deal, I'll take that
deal.

We enjoy our beverages then back out to the crawl. A few minutes later we stroll
into Inside Passage, which as it turns out does not like being called a tiki bar.
According to their website, they are "a Pacific Northwest, underwater, sunken
ship, tropical immersion bar... A bar which allows the guest to be transported
away the moment they enter and become immersed in a new reality. Windows to the
outside world are limited or closed off. The décor has an incredible amount of
detail which wraps around you and stays true to the concept and time period."

Cool, so can I get a drink?

I order The Turnbuckle, a Cynar based drink with a
dash of rum & passionfruit that I hope will tickle my fancy now that I'm
immersed. It arrives in a special Cynar artichoke glass that really adds to the
experience. They certainly don't skimp on the pageantry here. As anticipated,
the cocktail hits the spot, a perfect elixir to loosen my hips before booty
shaking.

We depart our underwater tropical immersion back into the concrete jungle of
downtown Seattle. It's just a few more blocks until we arrive at the Crocodile,
where we weave our way inside to a pretty packed house. It turns out
that this show is a pre-release party for their new album, *Cold as Weiss.*
Righteous. We find a nice little spot near the back of the
joint, but it's not a huge venue so we're still pretty close.

DLO3 comes out and they waste no time bringing down the house. Delvon is feelin'
it on the organ, Jimmy is bringing the juice on the
6 string, & Dan is right in the pocket, keeping everything on schedule. I'm
dancin'. I'm groovin'. I'm shakin' my booty.

About halfway through the show, Delvon's wife & manager, Amy Novo AKA Shortcake
Mafia, comes out to announce a secret show at the Kirkland Performance Center
in a few weeks. Unfortunately by that time I will have moseyed out of town but I
make sure to let Greg & Joanne know to catch it.

Amy is notorious from a
story that Delvon told on their last live album. During a show that the band put
on as part of their first annual Tacoma block party, Amy took the mic to
thank everyone for coming to the block party. But,
according to Delvon, and apparently everybody who was in attendance, the way Amy
says "block" sounds like "black." So when Amy thanked everyone for coming to the
first annual "Tacoma Black Party" the band knew they had to write a song called
Tacoma Black Party.

Enjoy.

The night is full of silky smooth grooves, playful jazz-funk riffs, and
face melting guitar solos. Their self-described brand of "feel good music"
drives deep into your soul, conjuring subconscious emotions that can only
manifest themselves through an ear to ear grin suspended above legs doing the
full tilt boogie. Even the surliest of curmudgeons couldn't help but bust a
move. It's the type of show you remember for a long, long time. It's the type of
show you can't wait to see again.

Laura makes it to the end of the show, despite waking up at the crack of dawn
yesterday & a body clock ticking 3 hours ahead. I think she was planning to
head home early but the concert was so damn good she couldn't leave. Either that or
she was just appeasing me. In any case we saw one hell of a show. We hail an Uber
for the ride back across Lake Washington to Greg & Joanne's & crash immediately
when we get back. What a night.

<h4 class="article-subheader" id="ballet">And Now for a Little Culture</h4>
We have a nice little Saturday planned today. Laura has arranged for us to
attend a performance at the Pacific Northwest Ballet - a little obscure show
written by some English guy called *Romeo & Juliet*. Laura, a dancer and avid
fan of dance, is thrilled. At one point she reprimands me for calling the PNB
the "Seattle Ballet," which, in her estimation, is one of the top ballet
companies in the US.

I've never been to a ballet in my life so I have no idea what to expect. Some
folks dancing about I suppose. We find our way to our seats in the mezzanine,
ready for a tale of star-crossed lovers engaged in a doomed tryst. As with most
assignments in high school, I didn't really pay attention when we read Romeo &
Juliet. Hell I probably didn't even read it. But I know the broad strokes, I'll
know what's going on.

Nope.

The plot of the first act is completely lost on me. I know there are the
Capulets & Montagues and they hate each other with the heat of a thousand suns.
But I couldn't tell you which family Romeo or Juliet belong to. So that's
where we're at.

Luckily the plot is just the loose facade upon which the choreography is hung.
You don't need to know the story to appreciate the artistic merit of the
dancers, whose movements are so fluid and effortless it's difficult to
comprehend. The skill & dexterity they display is a beautiful sight to behold.
Plus the meaty gams on the fellas are unbelievable. Beefcake alert!

The first act ends with the balcony scene & intermission. We head out to the
lobby, Laura offering astute & nuanced commentary regarding the artistic
interpretation, the quality of the dancers, and the set design. While I have such
enlightening questions as, "which ones are the Capulets & which ones
are the Montagues?" and "who's that Cary Elwes lookin' fella?" and

"What was with those weird one-eyed mask things they were wearing?"

"Are you serious??"

"Uhh yeah"

"Oh my god, Andrew. That was the Capulet masquerade ball, it's one of the most
important parts of the story, it's where Romeo falls in love with Juliet"

"Oh yeah, I caught that Romeo & Juliet part"

"Jesus, you're an idiot"

I don't think she actually said that last part, but she surely thought it. And,
the uncultured swine that I am, surely deserved it. After intermission we head
back in, armed with at least a cursory understanding of what's going on. The
second and third acts are just as dazzling as the first.

According to the PNB, the choreographer Jean-Christope Maillot has approached
the story from a fresh angle, instead of "focusing on themes of political-social
opposition between the two feuding clans, this Romeo and Juliet highlights the
dualities and ambiguities of adolescence. Torn between contradictory impulses,
between tenderness and violence, fear and pride, the lovers are caught in the
throes of a tragedy that exemplifies their youth and the extreme emotions and
internal conflicts that characterize that time of life"

I was just thinking that.

After \**spoiler alert*\* the young lovers die in each other's arms, we head back
out to the car. I couldn't help but notice how close we are to Holy Mountain
Brewing and Josie agrees to take the kids to the candy store. I order a flight
of *The Chariot* double IPA, *Throne of Blood* altbier, and two saisons, the
*Demonteller* and *Wall of Light*. The penultimate pour earns itself a full pint
upon conclusion of the flight.

Greg snags a four pack of the *The White Lodge* Belgian wit, his favorite
offering from the brewery, before we load back up headed for the land of Kirk.
We drop off the car at the house & stroll down to a Mexican restaurant called
Cactus. I've lived in Texas the past 7 years so my bar for Mexican food is
quite high. I order a margarita and the butternut squash enchiladas, which are
served stacked, New Mexico style, as opposed to rolled up like most enchiladas.
Low expectations be damned, both the cocktail and enchiladas are *outstanding*.
I prepared to be disappointed & was dazzled instead. Bravo, Cactus, bravo indeed.

We enjoy another round of drinks before hiking back up the hill to the house and
a little shuteye.

The next morning we arise with plans to hike
<a href="/traveler/2021_04-ski_trip/wp/day_9.html?id=falls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snoqualmie Falls</a>,
a 270-foot high waterfall (~100 feet higher than Niagara Falls) about 45
minutes away. We strap on our hikin' boots and load into the Jeep. The weather
is gorgeous, a perfect Sunday morning without a cloud in the sky.

Until we get to the falls.

About a mile out we drive into a thick fog. A fog that seems to have parked
itself right over our point of interest. We can hardly see to the other side of
the parking
lot but we venture out to the viewing platform anyway. To our supreme dismay the
falls are completely obscured from view. You can hear the thunderous clash of
rushing water cascading over the precipice. But you can't see a damn thing.

We decide
against the hike & head over to the lodge to see if there's at least a view
from there. No dice. But the gift shop has a book on the best bars in the world,
so I guess I got that goin' for me, y'know?

All I have to say is that Laura now has a convincing reason to come back to
Seattle to see the falls, as if *just seeing her cousin Joanne* weren't enough.

Since that plan was foiled, we decide to head down to Tacoma for brunch before
Laura's flight. With the phenomenal weather
everywhere else besides the falls, we should get great views of Mt. Ranier
from Tacoma. We head out from Snoqualmie & drive about 10 miles SSW on WA-18
when we hit a logjam. And I mean logjam. Cars aren't moving, guys are out of
their cars walking around, it's madness.

We sit for about 15 minutes, when the traffic inches forward enough to reach
a break in the concrete median & we whip the Jeep around. Cars are lined up for
at least 2 miles, stuck between dense forest on one side and a waist high
concrete median on the other. It's very
fortunate that we didn't get caught up in that mayhem, we probably would have
missed Laura's flight. After that detour we won't have time to do Tacoma so we
end up brunching at a place on the water in Renton, right next to a million
square foot plant where Boeing builds the 737.

After brunch, we whisk Laura Liz off to the airport, headed for Buffalo & the
real world. We exchange hugs and vow to see each other soon. And just like that
she's off.

My original itinerary had me heading to Canada tomorrow, however earlier this
week cousin Randy sent me a text that he found a great deal on a flight
to Bozeman. He wants to meet up with me for some Big Sky shredding. Sounds like
a hell of a deal, however the date is about a
week later than I had planned. I brainstorm for a bit and decide that a quick
trip down to Redwood National Forest wouldn't be the worst use of my time.

Let's go see what these big ass trees are all about.
