<h4 class="article-subheader">Memory Lane</h4>
Do you have a memory that's so strongly held it's become part of your identity?
A memory that's so fondly held that it's less of a memory and more of a
*feeling*? A childhood 

That place for me is Red River, New Mexico. The nickname for the state of New
Mexico is The Land of Enchantment and in this case the state has enchanted me.

The very first ski trip we took was 
We stayed in a cabin down the road from the main drag with a wood fired stove
for heat. I could be grievously misremembering but it was relatively rustic
in any case. Which is what was neat about it.

I know 100% for certain that it had a TV because we watched Nascar on Sunday.
My dad's not a particularly big Nascar fan but we were sure as shit watching
Nascar. Which means we're in at least February, because if it was any earlier
we'd be watching football. And now we're all so used to the Super Bowl being in
February it it never used to be. I can almost say with complete certainty this trip was during
President's Day weekend,

Log cabin. Wood fired stove.

Some things you are so completely certain of






<h4 class="article-subheader">Southbound & Down</h4>
The trip is starting to wind down, 32 days of skiing down and only 1 to go. I
gather up my things in Boulder and say goodbye to the Millennium Harvest, the
second spookiest hotel I've stayed at on a ski trip behind only the
<a href="/traveler/2021_04-ski_trip/wp/day_5.html?id=timberline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timberline</a>. Before I leave town I make my way to
Chautauqua Park for a quick picnic in the shadow of the Rockies. The weather is
perfect and the park is filled with dozens of Boulderites enjoying a nice lazy Sunday.

I don't linger too long because I have 300 miles of highway on my schedule today
and they ain't gonna drive themselves. I load back into the Pathfinder and start
findin' a path. The first few hours are uneventful interstate boredom, south on
I-25 with the Colorado Front Range to my right. At the northern flank of the
Sangre de Cristo Mountains I dive West and see the familiar sights of Northern
New Mexico that I remember so fondly from my youth. It's probably been 20 years
since I've been here and a strange sense of nostalgic familiarity and newness
is running through my veins.

I pull into Red River just as the ski day is wrapping up. Well, it *should* be
wrapping up. As I pull into the parking lot for my accommodation I see hundreds
of people gathered at the base of the hill with music blasting. I stroll into
the lobby to check in & inquire what that's all about. The woman behind the
counter informs me that it's the last day of the season here at Red River & this
is the end of season party they do every year. Well that's a hell of a deal,
unintentionally walking into a big party.

I'm actually going to be skiing another mountain tomorrow, Taos, that is a few
hundred feet higher in elevation and about 45 minutes from here. I decided to
stay in Red River mostly for the nostalgia factor. This was where I came on my
very first ski trip and a handful of trips in the following years. It's a little
mountain town but it holds a large place in my heart.

I get checked in and dump my bags and walk over to the festivities to see what's
going on. I sidle my way up to a small pond built right at the bottom of "The
Face" a run that I remember being about the size of Mt Everest when I was a kid
that now looks so unimpressive that I have a minor existential crisis on what is
even real. Why might we all be gathered around a small pond at the bottom of a
ski run you might ask... Well this is why:


Closing day is quite the party. I stand down by the pond for a few skiers, some
successful, some not, and a handful of snowboarders, all unsuccessful, before
sauntering over to the lodge with a bustling second story balcony overlooking
the festivities. While waiting in line for a beer I see a fella decked out in a
fabulous head-to-toe shiny leopard print ski suit. Someone in the crowd asks
how Red River Liberace is doing to which he replies,

"Honey, if I were any peachier I'd be a cobbler!"

Outstanding.

I sidle through the crowd to the bar for a plastic cup full of Happy Camper IPA,
which I tote back out to the patio. The sun is shining, the senders are sending,
and the music is blasting. It's a glorious day to be in Red River. I hang out on
the patio until the festivities wrap up and I throw back my beer. By this point
I've worked up a hell of an appetite and I know the exact place to scratch that
itch.

Texas Red's Steakhouse is the basis for dozens of my fondest childhood memories.
Even when we weren't skiing in or staying in Red River we would make the trek
around Wheeler Peak for supper at Texas Red's. Unlike some of the other
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/08-canada.html?id=longhorn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saloons</a> and
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/10-cowboy_state.html?id=mdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taverns</a>
I've encountered on this trip, this place is the real deal.

During the quarter mile stroll over to Texas Red's my mind is reeling with an
unhealthy carnal lust
for a medium rare T-bone steak. As I stride up the steps to the front door
I'm greeted with a horrifying sight that chills me to my bones.

I'm not old enough to remember the first two Bills Super Bowl losses, but I sure
as shit remember the second two against the goddamn Cowboys. This might hurt
worse.

I sit on the stoop for a minute and ponder if it's worth it to stay in Red River,
NM until May. I guess I'll mull it over with a beer.

I slowly trudge with my head hung low back towards the ski resort and duck into
the Red River Brewing Company. The place is jammed with people enjoying the
final days of skiing and watching March Madness. And I'd say 1 in 5 people are
wearing something from Oklahoma, which is pretty neat I reckon.

I put my name in for a table and grab a Powder Day Stout and pop a squat outside
on the patio around a gas firepit. Our old fabulous friend in the full leopard
skiing onesie sashays over

"Hey, I haven't seen you around, you must be new to town"

"Yeah I just got here today, just in time to see the pond skiing"

"Oh that's fun! It's our little crazy tradition for the close of ski season. I
don't ski but I dress the part. Name's Tyler, but everyone calls me Sweet T.
Don't ask me how long I've been here... It's been 7 years. By this point I know
everybody and everybody knows me. Is this your first time?"

"First time in probably 15 years, we came quite a few times when we were kids.
Everything seems so much smaller. It's all so different and so the same, it
feels... strange"

"Well it's our own little slice of heaven, we're not like those asshole ski
towns in Colorado"

"I agree. I like it here"

"Well that's fabulous, I hope you enjoy our little town"

"I sure will Sweet T"

<h4 class="article-subheader">This is it, Don't Get Scared Now</h4>
I can't believe we've made it here. The end of the road. One more day of skiing
then it's back to reality. I'm a little sad just thinking about it.

I pack up my gear one last time and head to the slopes. It's about 45 minutes
around the base of Wheeler Peak, the loftiest of peaks in the state, to Taos Ski
Valley. A light flurry of snow is falling as I pull into the parking lot & load
onto the tractor-pulled open-air cattle car.

I must have been completely oblivious to most things as a child because none of
this looks familiar. You would have thought that I would retained at least a
faint recollection of the six-story Swiss chalet-style hotel and Bavarian
village at the base of the hill. I only learn later that most of this was built
within the past decade, after the 2013 sale of the resort and the $330 million
master development plan that came along with it. At least I haven't completely
lost my marbles.

I strap on the planks for one final time in the shadow of said six-story Swiss
chalet-style hotel ready to shred. I hop on the unimaginatively named Lift 1
up the face of the mountain, straight up Al's Run. One thing I notice as I ride
up is that this mountain is *steep*. I must have ridden up slopes steeper than
this on my previous 22 ski hills but I really can't remember when.

Off the lift I loop around to the right and dive down Spencer's. Of the hundreds
of runs I've taken this trip I'm confident in saying that this is in the top-5
toughest. The substantial moguls that have 

23,000' of vert, bringing my total just over 600k. My total skiing distance
is 560 miles.

If I were able to ask him he'd probably say "oh, well, maybe? I dunno". Because
that would have been the hundredth ski trip of his life. It was my first. I
don't remember my second ski trip. Hell we probably went to Angel Fire.
