<h4 class="article-subheader">Memory Lane</h4>
Do you have a memory that's so strongly held it's become part of your identity?
A memory that has become less of a memory and more of a
*feeling*? A childhood experience that defines who you are?

As I pull into Red River, New Mexico I feel *that feeling* percolate to the
surface of my emotional reservoir. It hits me all at once like a ton of bricks.
The river bubbling to my right as I make the big swinging turn onto the main
drag. The symmetrical bluffs brooding over the entrance to town like Beefeaters
stoically safeguarding the Tower of London. The orange and blue clapboard
fa&ccedil;ade of the Terrace Towers Lodge. 

The rustic log cabins on the outskirts of town.

The cabins where it all began. If I had to guess I'd say I was about 8 years
old. My first ski trip. The first time this flatlander had ever experienced the
mountains.

They call New Mexico the Land of Enchantment and, brother, this young lad was
*enchanted*.

The excitement of cresting the top of the Cimarron
Canyon Pass was euphoric. The final culmination of 500 miles of steady climbing
from the lowly 700' elevation of Tulsa to our 8,000' perch above Eagle Nest Lake.

Our cabin was spartan. No frills. A minor step up from camping. Which is exactly
what you want as an 8 year old on your first mountain adventure. Watching your
old man stoke a wood burning potbelly stove for heat leaves an indelible
impression on a youngster.

The cabin did at least have a TV, which I can say with 100% certainty because
we watched Nascar on Sunday as we geared up to ski. My dad's not a particularly
big Nascar fan but he was that day. Perhaps it was a case of that long ago
stone-age habit of watching something "because it's on TV." Kids these days will
never know what that's like. The fact that we're watching Nascar means we're in
at least February, because if it was any earlier we'd be watching football.
Another thing these kids will never understand is a Super Bowl in January.

Memory is a peculiar, shapeless entity that rattles around in our minds in a
constant state amoebic fluidity. We like to think of our memory is like a book
that we can pull off the shelf any time we please. But in reality it's more of a
game of internal telephone. The cerebral scribe assigned to record your
memories is an indolent boob who refuses to write anything down, which is
quite literally in the job description of a scribe. So when you ask him to pull
the memory book off the dusty shelf deep in the crevasses of your mind he instead
just repeats what you told him. You then use this information how you please
then re-tell him the newly interpreted story and the process repeats again.

What I really like about this analogy, other than the outright preposterousness
of it, is that the logical conclusion is we have an infinite recursion of
cerebral scribes completely incompetent or unwilling to do their job. Sounds an
awful lot like corporate America.

In this particular case, my cerebral scribe reports that The Face, the piste
that fronts the Red River Ski Area, was as tall and steep as any peak you could
visit in the Himalayas. As I pull into town the downright diminutiveness of The
Face is incomprehensible and altogether unsettling. How.... how can it be
so.... *small*? It's fascinating that the same hunk of rock can form such a
divergent opinion in the brain of an 8 year old boy compared to a 33 year old
man (child?). Either I
grievously misremember the size of The Faaaaaace or the process of erosion
occurs in Red River, New Mexico at a pace some millions of times faster than
anywhere else on the planet. I can't say for sure.

What I can say for sure is that I've unwittingly stumbled upon a party.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Closing Day</h4>
I find myself pulling into Red River just as the ski day is wrapping up. Well,
just as it *should* be wrapping up. As I get closer to the hill I notice
hundreds of people gathered at the base of The Face decked out in all manner of
outrageous outfits and music blasting for all the town to hear. My accommodation
for the evening sits directly abreast of the party so when I stroll into
the lobby inquire what all the revelin's about. The woman behind the
counter informs me that it's my lucky day, I'm just in time for the end of the
season party. Well I'll be damned.

Thankfully I'm not planning to ski here tomorrow, I'll be shredding the famous
trails of Taos Ski Valley, a resort that's a couple thousand higher in elevation
so their season runs longer. I decided to stay in Red River mostly for the
nostalgia factor. It's just a sleepy little
mountain town but it holds a big place in my heart.

I check myself in and dump my bags before walking over to check out the
festivities. I sidle my way up to a small pond built right at the bottom of The
Face. Why might we all be gathered around a small pond at the bottom of a
ski run you might ask... Well this is why:


Closing day is quite the party. I stand down by the pond for a few skiers, some
successful, some not, and a handful of snowboarders, all unsuccessful, before
sauntering over to the lodge with a bustling second story balcony overlooking
the festivities. While waiting in line for a beer I see a fella decked out in a
fabulous head-to-toe shiny leopard print ski suit. Someone in the crowd asks
how Red River Liberace is doing to which he replies,

"Honey, if I were any peachier I'd be a cobbler!"

Outstanding.

I sidle through the crowd to the bar for a plastic cup full of Happy Camper IPA,
which I tote back out to the patio. The sun is shining, the senders are sending,
and the music is blasting. It's a glorious day to be in Red River. I hang out on
the patio until the festivities wrap up and I throw back my beer. By this point
I've worked up a hell of an appetite and I know the exact place to scratch that
itch.

Texas Red's Steakhouse is the basis for dozens of my fondest childhood memories.
Even when we weren't skiing in or staying in Red River we would make the trek
around Wheeler Peak for supper at Texas Red's. Unlike some of the other
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/08-canada.html?id=longhorn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saloons</a> and
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/10-cowboy_state.html?id=mdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taverns</a>
I've encountered on this trip, this place is the real deal.

During the quarter mile stroll over to Texas Red's my mind is reeling with an
unhealthy carnal lust
for a medium rare T-bone steak. As I stride up the steps to the front door
I'm greeted with a horrifying sight that chills me to my bones.

I'm not old enough to remember the first two Bills Super Bowl losses, but I sure
as shit remember the second two against the goddamn Cowboys. This might hurt
worse.

I sit on the stoop for a minute and ponder if it's worth it to stay in Red River,
NM until May. I guess I'll mull it over with a beer.

I slowly trudge with my head hung low back towards the ski resort and duck into
the Red River Brewing Company. The place is jammed with people enjoying the
final days of skiing and watching March Madness. And I'd say 1 in 5 people are
wearing something from Oklahoma, which is pretty neat I reckon.

</figure>

I put my name in for a table and grab a Powder Day Stout and pop a squat outside
on the patio around a gas firepit. Our old fabulous friend in the full leopard
skiing onesie sashays over

"Hey, I haven't seen you around, you must be new to town"

"Yeah I just got here today, just in time to see the pond skiing"

"Oh that's fun! It's our little crazy tradition for the close of ski season. I
don't ski but I dress the part. Name's Tyler, but everyone calls me Sweet T.
Don't ask me how long I've been here... It's been 7 years. By this point I know
everybody and everybody knows me. Is this your first time?"

"First time in probably 15 years, we came quite a few times when we were kids.
Everything seems so much smaller. It's all so different and so the same, it
feels... strange"

"Well it's our own little slice of heaven, we're not like those asshole ski
towns in Colorado"

"I agree. I like it here"

"Well that's fabulous, I hope you enjoy our little town"

"I sure will Sweet T"

<h4 class="article-subheader">This is it, Don't Get Scared Now</h4>
I can't believe we've made it here. The end of the road. One more day of skiing
then it's back to reality. I'm a little sad just thinking about it.

I pack up my gear one last time and head to the slopes. It's about 45 minutes
around the base of Wheeler Peak, the loftiest of peaks in the state, to Taos Ski
Valley. A light flurry of snow is falling as I pull into the parking lot & load
onto the tractor-pulled open-air cattle car.

I must have been completely oblivious to most things as a child because none of
this looks familiar. You would have thought that I would retained at least a
faint recollection of the six-story Swiss chalet-style hotel and Bavarian
village at the base of the hill. I only learn later that most of this was built
within the past decade, after the 2013 sale of the resort and the $330 million
master development plan that came along with it. At least I haven't completely
lost my marbles.

I strap on the planks for one final time in the shadow of said six-story Swiss
chalet-style hotel ready to shred. I hop on the unimaginatively named Lift 1
up the face of the mountain, straight up Al's Run. One thing I notice as I ride
up is that this mountain is *steep*. I must have ridden up slopes steeper than
this on my previous 22 ski hills but I really can't remember when.

Off the lift I loop around to the right and dive down Spencer's. Of the hundreds
of runs I've taken this trip I'm confident in saying that this is in the top-5
toughest. Colossal hillocks of hard snow frozen solid dot the run from start to
finish. substantial moguls that have 

At the top of the lift on my second run I slide over to the oversized trail map
to set up a game plan. As I'm digesting the terrain a gentleman in his mid-40s
asks if I want to go for a hike up the ridge. Hell I have no better plans, let's
do it. I unclip my skis and follow my new friend Dave from Colorado up a spine
that divides the West Basin Ridge to our right and the Highline Ridge to our
left. Dave opines that he'd prefer the Highline side, which provides runs with
comparable pitch to the West Basin Ridge but wider pistes than the gunbarrel
chutes of West Basin. ___________
ridge for some of the best Taos has to offer.


Ski about 5 more runs with Dave.

After I part ways with Dave I matriculate myself to the bottom of Lift 4,
where I see a big Bavarian-style lodge that looks like an excellent place to
grab a Bratwurst & liter of Warsteiner. I ditch my skis and walk up to the
aptly named Bavarian Restaurant with a watering mouth. I join a couple groups of
folks milling about the small foyer at the entrance to the joint. $18 for a
bratwurst. Head to German restaurant & wait for 10 minutes before anybody even acknowledges
I'm there.

No Kachina peak lift running




23,000' of vert, bringing my total just over 600k. My total skiing distance
is 560 miles.

<h4 class="article-subheader">A Memory Revisited</h4>


If I were able to ask him he'd probably say "oh, well, maybe? I dunno". Because
that would have been the hundredth ski trip of his life. It was my first. I
don't remember my second ski trip. Hell we probably went to Angel Fire.



<h4 class="article-subheader">Santa Fe</h4>
I pull into Santa Fe after dark and check in to El Sendero Inn, a
run-of-the-mill motor hotel that would come standard in your Post-War Americana
starter kit. To my delight the rooms appear to have been renovated in the past
few years, with little to no wear-and-tear, shockingly clean carpet, actually
comfortable beds, and sleek, modern appliances. Google is besmirching the good
name of the Sendero by calling it a "1-star hotel."

* Were there any Olympic events on today? I thought I watched some snowboarding or women's skiing

My short stay in Santa Fe did not start off on the right foot. As I open my Dopp
kit I notice everything is perplexingly coated with an an oily film. I pull
everything out and stack it on the sink when I find the culprit. My tincture of
beard oil has opened in transit and deposited its contents upon everything in
the toiletry bag with a slippery residue.

After cleaning up my amenities then myself I make the short walk to Hotel La
Fonda on the Plaza for what I hope is a dynamite serving of New Mexican
enchiladas. My first night of this trip I enjoyed enchiladas in Las Cruces, New
Mexico, it feels poetic to bookend the trip with New Mexican enchiladas.

New Mexican enchiladas possess two main qualities that differentiate them from
other families of of enchilada. The first is a general proclivity of New Mexican
cuisine, which is their use of green chiles. Most places when you order salsa
it's red. Because that's the color of salsa right? Not in New Mexico. It's such
a point of pride that residents of the great state of New Mexico have the option
of brandishing a license plate upon their vehicle with green chiles. My favorite
variant on the green chile/red chile dichotomy is "Christmas style" - half
green/half red. Because that just seems like more fun.

The second emphasis of New Mexican enchiladas is explicitly related to
enchiladas, and based on the strong feelings a disconcertingly large proportion
of the population hold about tropical fruits on pizza, likely to be controversial.
Instead of rolling the enchiladas in a tortilla sleeping bag, enchiladas in New
Mexico are laid flat and stacked like an order of flapjacks with the filling
in between the tortilla scaffolding.

About half way through my libation the enchiladas arrive and I immediately
notice something is wrong. I look up to the unsuspecting waitress,

"They're not flat."

"Oh I'm sorry, did you want them flat?"

"I thought that's how y'all did it in New Mexico?"

"Well typically it is, but we get so many tourists that come in here and throw
a fit that we started rolling them. Do you want me to have them
re-do it?"

"Oh no, this is totally fine, I just had my heart set on some authentic New
Mexican enchiladas"

"Are you sure you don't want me to send them back?""

"No these look great. Thank you so much."

So I ate some lame ass rolled up enchiladas.

Seinfeld enchilada rollers?

Thinking back over this interaction I think I might have to start working
"That won't be necessary" into my lexicon.

"They're not flat"

"Oh I'm sorry, did you want them flat?"

*Don Draper glare-squint* "That won't be necessary."



My last stop as I leave town is Ohori's Coffee, which is one of my favorite
coffee shops I've ever patronized. Did it used to be something else????
The large windows allow the first rays of the morning to caress the adobe walls
and glint off the
stainless steel apparati of the espresso machine. The high ceilings give the
feel of a space that's much larger than a coffee shop should be. The Southwestern
vibe is accentuated by Talin Market right next door, specializing in world
cuisines and native staples.



As I leave Santa Fe I take a peek at the trip odometer. 10,450.9 miles.




<h4 class="article-subheader">Southbound & Down</h4>
The trip is starting to wind down, 32 days of skiing down and only 1 to go. I
gather up my things in Boulder and say goodbye to the Millennium Harvest, the
second spookiest hotel I've stayed at on a ski trip behind only the
<a href="/traveler/2021_04-ski_trip/wp/day_5.html?id=timberline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timberline</a>. Before I leave town I make my way to
Chautauqua Park for a quick picnic in the shadow of the Rockies. The weather is
perfect and the park is filled with dozens of Boulderites enjoying a nice lazy Sunday.

I don't linger too long because I have 300 miles of highway on my schedule today
and they ain't gonna drive themselves. I load back into the Pathfinder and start
findin' a path. The first few hours are uneventful interstate boredom, south on
I-25 with the Colorado Front Range to my right. At the northern flank of the
Sangre de Cristo Mountains I dive West and see the familiar sights of Northern
New Mexico that I remember so fondly from my youth. It's probably been 20 years
since I've been here and a strange sense of nostalgic familiarity and newness
is running through my veins.
