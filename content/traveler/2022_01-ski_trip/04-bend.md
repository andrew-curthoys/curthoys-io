"Yeah, this is terrible, let's pop in the lodge & check the forecast"

And so went our third ride up the lift.

The first two weren't great. But this time the winds picked up and the rain got
heavier.

That's right. ***Rain.***

We shuffle into the Pine Martin lodge to reassess. A ski patroller tells us we
made the right decision, conditions are that
bad. We sit down and check the weather. Looks like the fog & rain will let up
a bit in a half hour. We strip our gear to wait out the weather, thankful we're
in here and not out there. 

The wind is coming from the west, which means the Cloudchaser lift should be
protected over on the East side of the hill. After our rain delay,
we gear back up and traverse across to the other side. The conditions over here,
while not great, are significantly better than where we came from. We lap
Cloudchaser a few times & I can tell Landon is having a much better time. Must
be a *touch* easier to get your snowboard legs under you when you can actually
see where the hell you're going.

As lunchtime approaches we head back around the frontside to see if
conditions have improved. If anything it's gotten worse. At this point in the
day we're so wet it looks like we've walked through a car wash.

We trudge into the base lodge to dry off but soon realize that all we've done is make
ourselves cold.
I look at Landon and he doesn't seem to have a strong hankerin' to head back up.
I feel bad because he only has 3 days here but you can't beat Mother Nature. We
decide to call it a day after 9 runs, not great not terrible. We load up the car
and hit the road back to Bend.

No more than a mile down the road we drive out of the fog into bright, beautiful
blue skies. You've got to be shitting me. But that's the way that the world goes
'round.

We set our course for Cascade Lakes Brewery, which, according to their
website, boasts a fireplace. Sounds like an ideal spot for clothes drying and
apr&egrave;s beers to me. Landon agrees.

Upon arrival we find that the fireplace is actually a huge outdoor firepit, which should
do the trick just the same. We peel off our wet clothes & arrange them around the
fire to desiccate. Landon ventures inside to order a round of suds. The beers
are delicious and the fire hot. So hot, in fact, that it starts to melt the
bottom of Landon's shoe at one point.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Watch your moccasins there bud</figcaption>
</figure>

We decide to order another round to allow more time for our gear to dry, but in
reality the beers are so damn good we couldn't have just one. After round
deux it's back to the Econolodge. We have a big adventure planned for tonight -
trekking to the last Blockbuster in the world. But that's another story for
another time. It's just so ludicrous it deserves its own post.

So for now we'll just fast forward to Friday morning, bloodshot eyes and a
pressing need for greasy food. As luck would have it there's a greasy spoon
right in the parking lot of the motel. Hell of a deal.

Laurie's Grill is exactly what you'd expect out of a joint in the parking lot of
an Econolodge. And exactly what we need. The breakfast sandwich on a biscuit
with an included cup of coffee hits the spot better than Davy Crockett in a
shootout with Bigfoot. Landon's breakfast burrito looks pretty outstanding as
well. Just the fuel for a bluebird day at Bachelor.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Let's Try This Again</h4>

The main draw of Mt Bachelor is the Summit chair. It accesses the top of the
volcanic cone, above the treeline where the other chairs terminate. As we pull
into the Sunrise Lodge I see Summit loading chairs onto the rope. Now we're
talkin'.

We strap on the gear and hit the Sunrise chair. When we hop off we see that
Summit is on hold. *Welllll helllll*. Alright, we'll head over to the
Outback/Northwest
chairs to ride some trails we didn't get a chance to hit yesterday. The snow is
ok, a bit icy in spots, but rippable and the runs are longer than the
trails off Cloudchaser. After a few laps I check the Mt Bachelor app to find the
Summit chair finally off wind hold. Fuckin A.

We make the traverse around to the base of Summit where ski patrol is
melodramatically dissuading skiers from heading up.

"EXPERTS ONLY"

"It's *EXTREMELY* icy"

"We really shouldn't even have the lift open right now with the conditions up
there"

"You better be a damn good skier and in love with your edges"

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've been up there, you've got two groomed runs that aren't
even that steep. Spare me with the histrionics.

It does fluster Landon for a quick second but he shoots me a confident look that
implies he's ready to send it. The Summit is the main reason to come to
Bachelor anyways.
As we ascend it appears the biggest safety hazard will be other nimrods straight
lining down the hill as fast as they can. I tell Lando to stay to skiiers right
and we should be just fine.

</figure>

We hop off the lift, and just as I expected, it's not that bad. I think ski
patrol was just trying to keep the Jerrys away. We carve our way down Beverly Hills
in style back to the bottom of Summit. While waiting for Landon I
see a ski patroller come down with an avalanche dog on his shoulders. The dog is
*chillin*.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Air Bud 2: Electric Pooder Hoond</figcaption>
</figure>

That was a great run so we hop right back on Summit. On our way up we start
chatting with a guy who's probably in his early-to-mid 20s named Mitchell. He's
local to the area and has been skiing this mountain since he was a tot. The
thing I've realized about skiers with a home mountain is that, to a man, they
will claim that their mountain is the best skiing mountain on god's green earth.
Mitchell is no different, "I've skied all over,
and I might be biased, but on a good day you can't beat Bachelor"

Now I love Mt. Bachelor, and yesterday notwithstanding, don't have a bad word to
say about it. But I have a hard time believing that it's superior to every ski
hill spinning chairs. But, of course, I don't tell Mitch that. I just nod,
"hell yeah man, I love it out here."

He says
the best snow today is over the other side of the mountain, down the
Backside Bowls. I ask him if it's cool to follow him and he agrees to be my ski
sherpa. Giddy up. I chat with Landon & we decide to meet back up at the top of
Sunrise after my little excursion with Mitch.

We hop off the lift, Landon peeling left for the groomer, Mitchell & I heading
straight for the backside. At the top of the cornice that drops down into the
bowl, Mitchell gives me a thumbs up & *swoosh,
swoosh, swoosh* skillfully negotiates three jump turns into the bowl. I
give it a look and the entrance looks, well, *challenging*. Nothing left to do
but commit to the send. I slide down the
icy wall, clumsily execute a jump turn, slide down the ice some more, another
inelegant jump turn, another icy skid. I eventually reach a point where I can
ride it out to a decent patch of snow. It was a baby giraffe to Mitchell's
graceful gazelle.

But I made it.

Mitch is about halfway down the top section of the bowl where I meet him,
skiing much more deftly. He continues down the bowl, effortlessly negotiating
the combination snow/ice/crud, hitting kickers, booters, balletically flying
through the mountain air. I follow, avoiding the jumps, straining a bit more on
the terrain. He's right, there are pockets of good snow back here, but most of
it is pretty hard and chunky. The good pockets of soft snow are magical, but
just as soon as you get used to the soft fluffy velvet, the Cascade Concrete
returns, chattering your knees like a sewing machine.

<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/bend_backside.jpeg" alt="Bachelor backside">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">At least the view was nice</figcaption>
</figure>

On a powder day this would be outstanding. But today it's just not ideal. We
make it to a point where Mitch asks if I want to follow him through the trees
and I decline, heading for the catchline that carries skiers back around to the
frontside of the mountain. I hop on the Northwest chair then traverse over to
the top of Sunrise where I meet Landon.

From here we take a groomie down to the base of the Pine Martin chair. While in
line, the liftie coordinating the queue operations shouts out a question to the
amalgam of humanity.

"I have a trivia question for everyone! What is the name of the South Sister?"

"Charity!" shouts a woman from the middle of the pack

"Who said that? Come on up here, you're next in line!"

The sisters he is referring to are the Three Sisters mountains, a trio of
closely spaced volcano peaks about 10 miles northwest of us. They were named
Faith, Hope, & Charity in the 1840s by Methodist missionaries. Each of the
sisters rises over 10,000', the highest peaks in Oregon behind Mt. Hood & Mt.
Jefferson. Mt Bachelor is so named because he stands alone, separated from the
sisters.

Once at the top of the hill we slide over to the mountaintop lodge for a little
sunshine & beer. We saunter up to the bar right at last call for a couple
brewskis to enjoy on the patio. The view is remarkably better than yesterday.

After enjoying the beers and the views it's just a nice easy cruise down to the
Sunrise Lodge and the car. Except about halfway down I get a strange
feeling like we're going the wrong way. The feeling is confirmed shortly
thereafter when we arrive at the West Village Lodge.

Well dadgum.

Somewhere on the top ridge we must have dropped down too soon. Best not make the
same mistake again since lifts are gettin' awful close to quittin' time. We'd be
in quite the pickle, given that the two lodges are 2 miles apart. This time
up we make sure to stay on the high traverse and see the spot where we blundered
the first time. 

All told, we skied just under 21,000 vertical feet. A solid day
on the slopes.

</figure>

We make it back to the car, much drier and jauntier than yesterday. We load up
and head for Bend Brewing. I figure we can apr&egrave;s there &
Deschutes since they are right across the street from each other. We mosey into
Bend Brewing and the Chiefs guy is behind the bar. We exchange some good natured
ribbing, which confuses Landon because he wasn't here the other night when we
were chirping at each other. We each order a pint and settle into some Adirondack
chairs in the backyard overlooking the Deschutes River.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">We actually earned our suds today</figcaption>
</figure>

Mikey's friends Adam & McKenzie told me that during the summer folks will float
this river, drifting up to various docks to revel and exchange beers.
Today the water is too cold for all others besides the mighty duck. Landon, for
whatever reason, is a big fan of the family *Anatidae*.

<h4 class="article-subheader">What the Duck</h4>

"Land, air, and sea, man. The duck can do it all."

Can't argue with him there. As we watch the waterfowl dive down for supper, I
wonder aloud how long they stay down there. I grab my phone and
start timing their fluvial expeditions. For ducks on the
Deschutes River at a quarter to five on the 21st of January we determined that
the average diving time was 15 seconds.

This falls within the typical range of 10-30 seconds for diving ducks, a simple
fact that, when discovered, should have been the beginning and end of my duck
research. However I soon found myself down a rabbithole of duck facts, some of
which I have selected to bore you, dear reader.

<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/bend_duck_rabbit.png" alt="Rabbit or Duck">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Rabbit or duck?</figcaption>
</figure>

Diving ducks are a distinct tribe within the *Anatinae* subfamily, separate from
the dabbling ducks, who feed mostly at the surface. News to me that there are
two completely different types of ducks and the fact that there exists a *tribe*
rank in the taxonomic classification system. According to the USDA
Forest Service, the following diving ducks are found in Central Oregon:
Barrow's Goldeneye, Bufflehead, Canvasback, Common Goldeneye, Common Merganser,
Greater Scaup, Harlequin Duck, Hooded Merganser, Lesser Scaup, Long-tailed Duck,
Red-breasted Merganser, Redhead, Ring-necked Duck, Surf Scoter, White-winged
Scoter.

15 species of duck. And that doesn't even include the dabbling ducks.
Surprisingly this plethora of duck has nothing to do with the mascot for the
flagship university in the state where we are currently recreating. But that's
another story.

Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the diving duck is it's physiology. Their
bodies and wings are much more compact than dabblers, and their legs are set
farther back on their body to assist in underwater propulsion. They can store an
abundance of oxygen in their blood & are resistant to the effects of
CO<sub>2</sub> buildup that affect most terrestrial vertebrates. Once
underwater, special
receptors in its nostrils induce a "diving reflex" to reduce
oxygen consumption, slow heart rate, and divert blood flow to essential
organs. On bottom, they use their feet to maintain a hovering position
while feeding, scrounging on anything from aquatic insects, small mollusks,
seeds, vegetation, roots, and tubers. When they are done they simply stop
paddling and pop up to the surface like a feathered cork.

Of course David Attenborough has a video detailing the feeding habits of the
diving duck. The surfacing is pretty adorable. At
the time of writing the top comment for this video was, "Ducks and geese
are the few animals I know that can do air, land, and sea. How cool is that?"
Landon may have a duckophile posse he isn't aware of.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Meanwhile, back on dry land</h4>

After concluding our waterfowl observations we step across the street to
Deschutes Brewing. We find a high top at the bar and I order a Red Chair
Northwest Pale Ale, the namesake of which is the Red Chair at Mt Bachelor, the
oldest lift at the mountain, running continuously since 1964.
While we are enjoying our
barley sammiches and pub fries a group of lads stumbles in and sits at an
adjacent table. This feels like a bachelor party (no pun intended), it's
definitely more than just a ski trip with the buds.

They are friendly enough and we crack a few jokes back & forth. A few of them
start whispering among themselves, one of them nods, and they make a beeline for
the restrooms. It seems these guys brought their own powder to make up for the
powder paucity on the slopes. Their waitress comes around for their order, which, of
course, they are not ready for. After straining to activate the few functioning
neurons between them they arrive at an order. As the waitress heads to put it
in, they shout what they seem to think is the funniest thing to ever be said,

"Hey! Can you put Adderall on the wings?"

She shoots them a glare with *they don't pay me enough for this shit* energy.

Landon and I dump down our beers and settle up before heading back to the car.
On our way to the Econolodge, we pass by a bar that exudes a nonsensical
silliness that I can't resist.

"Hey that bar looks pretty stupid, let's hit that up on our way back through town"

"Sounds good to me"

We dump our gear at the motel & get ourselves cleaned up. We walk back into town,
straight to the silly looking pub with the delightfully silly name, *McMenamins
Old St. Francis Pub*. We enter a wood paneled public house sporting a substantial
four-sided bar, replete with plentiful bottles of hooch, unique glassware, wooden
booths, old world memorabilia, and stained glass windows.
It would remind me of an authentic Irish pub if I had ever been to Ireland. I'm
delighted.

We belly up and order a pint of the Terminator Stout, a choice befitting of the
milieu of the Old St. Francis. Over our flagons of ale we strike up a
conversation with the retired couple next to us. They are on a similar trek to
mine, touring around to as many mountains on the Ikon pass as they can. Tim, who
hails from Ontario, isn't afraid to cut it up; Bunny, a Coloradoan, uses her
sharp wit to keep Tim in line.

<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/bend_tim_bunny.jpeg" alt="Tim & Bunny">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">An international symposium of enlightened minds</figcaption>
</figure>

In between discussions of our respective ski trips I mention how much I love
this bar. They ask if we've heard of McMenamins, to which we reply in the
negative. They inform us that it's a group that buys old buildings in the
Pacific Northwest & rehabilitates them into functioning pubs, with the intention
to preserve as much of the buildings' original charm as possible. This particular
location sports a hotel, pub, brewery, event spaces, concert hall, and soaking
pool, all within the confines of a 1936 Catholic schoolhouse.

McMenamins bought the place in 2004 and converted it into a "wonderfully
uncommon hotel and pub." Their website states,

*We honor the property's former life by featuring extensive artwork that pays
homage to the history of the school and the surrounding community. Photos,
memorabilia, our artists' renderings, and students' artwork adorn the walls,
making the hotel a unique gallery of sorts.*

If I find my way back to Bend I will certainly book a room at the Old St.
Francis.

We finish our pints and wish Tim & Bunny good fortune and travel mercies for the
rest of their journey. The remainder of our night is spent bar hopping around
downtown Bend, culminating in perhaps the best hot toddies I've ever had at San
Sim&oacute;n. It's been a long day and we've stayed out too late. We head back
to the Econolodge for some well deserved shuteye.

<p class="section-divider my-4">&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;</p>

I feebly roll out of bed and peek through a half opened crusty eye to see
that Landon is even worse for wear that I. We sluggishly pack our bags and
strap on our ski gear in a foggy haze of regret. We're in such a state that only
McDonald's breakfast has a fighting chance to alleviate our languor. A McMuffin
& coffee on the way to the mountain at least gets my engine up to a slow idle.

Our lethargic start & the fact that it's a Saturday means that we're not getting a
good parking spot. We find a spot near the back of the lot and schlep through
the icy parking lot to the base of the Red Chair. There is a ski team of
middle-school aged kids ahead of us in line, gossiping, laughing, throwing snow.
Enjoying being here.

Wouldn't know anything about that.

We ride the rickety lift to the top, watching ski practice off to our right. At
the top we peel off left for the Pine Martin express chair. I start down the
slope & muscle memory kicks in. It's an easy cruise down the groomer, the wind
against my face & mild exercise invigorating my beleaguered spirit.

I make it to the bottom and wait for Landon. And wait... And wait... And wait...
I start to
worry a bit that he's hurt himself, a worry that's well founded given his injury
history. I check my phone. Nothing. Better than a text that he's broken his
collarbone. Eventually I see the boy making his way down the Midway run.

He slides to a stop & shakes his head

"I'm done"

"Damn, really?"

"Yeah, you can go ahead, I'll just wait for you in the lodge."

Sometime it just ain't your day. He was feeling pretty shaky given last night's
festivities and a few small spills shook his confidence even more. The ski
slope is definitely nowhere you want to be if you're feeling unsure of yourself.
No sweat, I'll just do a few more runs & we can skedaddle. We have to get out of
town by 13:00 anyways so Mikey can stop at a few shops in Portland this evening.

Landon slinks off to the lodge and I scoot down to the Pine Martin chair. When I
arrive I discover that the line is *extensive*. Super lame. While I'm queued I
start chatting with the couple behind me. Somehow we discover that Melissa went
to the same high school as my mother, just one year behind her. There are
coincidences and then there are *coincidences*. This particular coincidence would be even
more fabulous if they were best friends in high school or something. Unfortunately,
neither recalls the other. In spite of that it's pretty remarkable, two Okies
standing in this specific spot in a massive chairlift line in central Oregon. I
wish the line speed increased with improbability of coincidences.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Yuck</figcaption>
</figure>

I finally load up, shouting a "pistols firin'!" back to OSU alumna Melissa. The
ride down is silky smooth, a nice easy coast down the groomies. When I
reach the bottom I joylessly come to terms that it was my last run of the
day. The line hasn't shortened and the time it will take to ride up & back down
will put us behind schedule to Portland. A classic two run Saturday.

We lumber back to the car & hit the road to Bend to pick up Mikey. He
shuffles out of Adam & McKenzie's house looking like he tied one on last night
himself. He confirms as much, chronicling their whiskey soaked nocturnal
escapades. On the way out of town we decide to grab lunch at the new Chick-fil-A.
It's the talk of the town - I can recall at least a half dozen conversations
with folks regarding the Chick-fil-A. It's a peculiar topic to obsess over given
Bend's plethora of enjoyable activities both in and out of doors. And boy are
they obsessed - the line for the chicken shack is across the parking lot and
down the street. It's so long that it's disrupting traffic for the shopping
center surrounding it.

We call an audible and pivot to Chipotle, a risky proposition for three guys on
a road trip. Thankfully the only Chipotle stains I receive are on the outside of
my clothes. And we're still on schedule. A minor miracle.

As we drive out of Bend and into the Oregon High Desert the conversation begins
the slow process of communication atrophy. The answers grow shorter. The gaps
between topics grow longer. The consciousness of the group melds with the
tranquility of the vast plateau. A particularly pregnant conversational hiatus
is interrupted by my observation that Mt Jefferson is majestically rising above
the plain out the left side of the car. An observation that is acknowledged by
nary a "hmmm", "ahh", "ohhh", or otherwise guttural emanation. I look over at
Landon, then at Michael in my rearview.

Both are sound asleep.

</figure>

I guess they just expect me to captain this ship by myself.

My ensigns sporadically rouse themselves as we approach the Mt Hood National
Forest. I ask if they'd like to check out 
<a href="/traveler/2021_04-ski_trip/wp/day_5.html?id=timberline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timberline</a>,
which should only be a 20 minute detour. They are interested so we make the turn
off the highway up a few miles of switchbacks to the lodge.

The parking lot is substantially fuller than my journey here last year.
Thankfully the lodge is open for us to poke around. I show them some highlights
of the vaulted wood and stone lodge and hit them with a few fun facts that I
gleaned from my stay last year. After a short perusal of the building we head
back to the car for our final descent into Portland.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">What a beaut</figcaption>
</figure>

I am chagrined to say goodbye to my old friend Mt. Hood. We shall meet again,
ol chap.

Our schooner pulls into Portland just after 4 o'clock, plenty of time for
Michael to hobnob with some jewelers. Of the myriad jewelry stores that call
Portland home, Michael has found but two that might fit his brand. He only wants
to work with merchants whose vibe matches the sui generis aesthetic that
defines his approach to design.

To his mild surprise, both stores exceed his modest expectations. They are
keenly receptive to his pitch and look forward to the launch of
his website with great eagerness. Michael is happy. He trusts the process.

<p class="section-divider my-4">&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;</p>

Landon got us a deal on a hotel by the water. If we had any energy I'd wish it
were closer to the downtown bar district. As it stands I'm happy for a 4 star
hotel at a 2 star price. After checking in we walk next door to the generically
named Portland Sports Bar & Grill for the Packers-49ers game. We arrive just
as AJ Dillon caps an opening drive TD for the Pack. This should be a
blowout, there's no way that Jimmy G keep up with ARdog.

*But that's.. why.. they play.. the game*.

Inexplicably, the Packers can only muster another 3 points the rest of the night.
Completely explicably, the Packers commit a special teams blunder.
A blocked punt TD breathes life into the listless 49ers, who seal the W
with a last second FG from the ageless Robby Gould. 13-10 '9ers.

After the game we settle up and head back to the accommodation. Landon has a
flight first thing in the morning so we say our goodbyes before hitting the sack.

With that we've reached the end of the Oregon Trail. The Emerald State beckons
in the morn'.

But first, about that Blockbuster thing....
