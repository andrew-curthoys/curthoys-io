<h4 class="article-subheader">"Do you have any food in the car?"</h4>
"Yes sir, I uhhhh have some bananas, apples, a bag of oranges, trail mix, a few cans
of soup, pretzels, jerky... y'know just some food for the road"

"Ok I'm going to need you to pull up into that stall to the left and step inside
the facility."

Goddammit.

And that's how I ended up sitting in the atrium of the Peace Arch
Canadian Border Patrol office for over an hour watching the China-Canada curling
match.

This is a most unfortunate development, seeing as I departed Kirkland much later
than I had hoped. Plus my Super Bowl Monday headache is roaming the amorphous
region between splitting and throbbing. I got a little too into the wine and the
beer yesterday and I *really* just want to get to Whistler, BC.

Gordo\* finally calls me back up to his official looking desk to inform me that
their search for contraband has been completed. I'm free to go. He almost seemed
disappointed that he couldn't put a Yank behind bars. Whatever Gord, I gotta hit
the road.

*I don't remember his actual name but it was probably Gordo

Before me lies two and a half hours of Northbound travel, through Vancouver,
through Squamish, between the volcanic arc of the Garibaldi Range and the
Squamish River. Down two lane roads where you can drive 100. (Unfortunately that's
*kilometers* per hour - almost exactly 60 miles per hour - which is a
disappointingly meager rate in a land self-described as the Great White North.)

Nightfall is already upon us, which is disappointing because I
can tell from the moonlight that I'm missing some dazzling views. I pull into
Whistler at a quarter to ten, headed for the Pangea Pod hotel. Described as a
"chic shared pod hotel," it's the most modestly priced lodging in town.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Whistler</h4>

As I turn down the road in front of the hotel I am confronted by a collection
of signs emphatically outlawing the parking of vehicles precisely where I would
like to park my vehicle. If we're speaking in generalities I would sheepishly
call myself a rule follower. Sounds strange coming from someone fucking off
from his job to embark on a 3 month ski vacation doesn't it? Because of this
particular character trait of mine I take a lap around the block to find a spot
where I can licitly park my rig for check-in.

The cursory search proves unfruitful so I tie up the ol gal to some bollards in
front of the hotel & anxiously hope I don't get a ticket. A flustered young
woman behind the front desk welcomes me and delivers a
faltering spiel about the hotel. The majority of the check-in process is done
via an iPad that I tap-tap-tap away at until the payment section, at which point
the tablet freezes. I see a wave of anxiety wash over the desk agent,
who then informs me it's only her second day on the job.

I attempt to assuage her anxiety with nonsensical and presumably nonhumerous
banter as I patiently wait for her to reset the iPad & the process begins anew.
Second time is a charm and she affixes a bracelet to my wrist that will
function as my room key. I grab my gear & head up to the "D" wing, where I find
my pod, D71.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Welcome to my home</figcaption>
</figure>

The sleeping
arrangements consist of 6 "pods" per room, which are fully enclosed bunks with
some shelves, outlets, and a light. The size of the pods are surprisingly large,
with room enough for my backpack & suitcase. We also have designated
locker/cubby areas for overflow storage. I drop off my gear & head back
downstairs to find some sanctioned parking. I ask Ms. Flustered if there is a
garage for vehicles over 7' tall, given that their garage only fits cars up to
6'8". This line of questioning, as you can imagine, does nothing to alleviate
her angst & she asks a co-worker for assistance. The co-worker points me in the
direction of the conference center garage, which she assures me will suffice.

I head back out to the car & after a short drive find that it will
not, in fact, suffice. I continue driving around the winding streets of
Whistler, looking for a garage, a lot, anywhere I can stable my weary steed for
the night. None of the lots seem to
allow overnight parking and all the garages seem to top out at 6'8". Does
nobody come here with a roof rack?? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.

Eventually I find a garage under the library that will accommodate my somewhat
but not unreasonably tall vehicle.

The main reason I added Whistler to my itinerary was Casey's vehement insistence
I come here while we were gallivanting through California. He said the skiing
is great & the town is a riot. I have
a couple hours before bed, so let's give that latter postulation a test. From
the garage I spill out onto a wide pedestrian thoroughfare amongst shops,
restaurants, & bars. I wander around town for a while to get the lay of the land
before dipping into the Amsterdam Cafe. I belly up to the bar and order a rye
Old Fashioned that I sip while people watching and occasionally glancing at the
Olympics coverage. The concoction was so nice I order it twice, a delicious
nightcap before turning in for the night.

I settle up with the barmaid & head back out into the crisp Canadian night for
the easy stroll back to the hotel. About a hundred yards from the entrance to
the Pangea I hear a "oi! where are you from!" I spin around to see a couple
rambling up the path behind me.

"From the States, Oklahoma"

"Oooooohk-luh-hoema? I've never even heard of that.... Ohhhh wait, isn't there an
Ohkluhoemuh song?"

"Yeah, it's called... 'Oklahoma', Rodgers and Hammerstein."

"I knew it!!! Ohkluhoemuh"

"Where are you from?"

"I'm from New Zealand & my friend Charlie here is from France. My name's
Courtney"

"Andrew, it's a pleasure"

"Where are you going?"

"To bed"

"Noooooooo, we're going to the Irish Pub, come have a drink with us!"

"No thank you, I appreciate the offer, however I am tired and have a big day of
skiing planned tomorrow. Y'all have a lovely evening," is what I *should* have
said.

"Well..... alright," is what I *actually* said.

I haven't the slightest shred of a backbone when it comes to peer pressure.

I follow my new friends to the public house, picking up Phoebe from Australia along
the way. Courtney tells me I'll love their English friend Claire - she has a
boyfriend but "he's the wooorst. You & Claire will hit it off."

Whatever you say Courtney.

We find their friends at a high top, Courtney summarily introducing me to Claire,
whose boyfriend Tristan is sitting right next to her. Not really sure what
Courtney is expecting me to do with this 3rd & 25 behind a 3rd string offensive
line. We order a round of Guinnesses & I inquire as to how the international
consortium with which I find myself came to be. Turns out they all work at a
hotel in town together.

Pretty straightforward.

I ask them if I'm crazy or have I heard an absurdly high number of accents
in the short time I've been in Whistler. They assure me I'm not losing
my marbles, this town is a ski bum UN. The largest percentage come from
Australia I'm told, a diasporic population resulting from their favourable
immigration status with Canada.
In the middle of the conversation Courtney jumps up, "oh that guy looks rich,
I'm going to see if he'll be my sugar daddy!"

There wasn't a hint of facetiousness in her voice.

While we're all sitting there chatting, a ceaseless rotation of my young hosts
leave the table for a few minutes at a time. I notice each time one returns he
or she looks uncommonly alert. Young kids from all over the globe working hotel
jobs on weird schedules. I get it.

I duck out when the bartender comes around for last call, I really need
to get some sleep. My quick walk back to the hotel is uninterrupted by carousing
expats & I crash hard in my pod, ready for another day on the slopes.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Let's Go Skiing, Eh?</h4>
I wake up surprisingly refreshed, all things considered, and walk across the
square for a cup o' joe. I down
the delicious brew as I gear up & hoof it towards the hill. The location of the
pod hotel is outstanding, only a couple hundred yards from the bottom of the
gondola. Actually, gondola<b>s</b>.

The ski resort is a conglomeration of two formerly independent ski areas,
Blackcomb and Whistler. Whistler came first, conceived as part of a bid to host
the 1968 Winter Olympics, which ended up going to Grenoble, France. Blackcomb
opened for business in 1980, which set off a fierce rivalry of technology
upgrades and improvements until the late 90s, when the real estate firm that
developed Blackcomb purchased Whistler. They were fully merged in 2003, creating
the largest ski area in North America (either mountain alone would rank in the
top 5. This place is *big*). And after 42 years, Whistler was finally awarded
its Olympics in 2010.

If you're standing in the mountain village and look up and to the left, you'll
see Blackcomb Mountain. Up & to the right, Whistler. The mountains are
separated by Fitzsimmons Creek cutting a deep valley between the two. All the
ski runs & lifts for both mountains funnel down to the mountain village, allowing
skiers to ride up either side depending on their inclination at that particular
moment. And if you find yourself at the summit of Blackcomb & get a hankerin'
for Whistler, that ain't no problem, just ride the Peak2Peak gondola right over
the gorge to the other side! More on that later.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Biggest skiing in North America</figcaption>
</figure>

As I waddle up to the base area I look up at the mountains, and to my chagrin,
I can't see past the second lift tower. The hill is enveloped in a thick layer
of fog. *Oh this again*. I sigh and I decide to head to the Blackcomb side first,
for no other reason than its gondola is closer than Whistler's.

I hop onto the Excalibur Gondola, unaware that this particular conveyance only
goes up about a third of the way up the mountain. It's really a nonsensical
lift & appears to owe its entire existence to serving both mountains from the
same base area. In hindsight, I should have taken the Whistler Gondola,
which sits a mere sand wedge away from the one I 
hopped on. In my defense the trail map is slightly deceiving, placing the
unloading station for the gondola precariously close to the loading station for
the Excelerator Express quad, which I assumed to be a continuation of the
gondola on my perfunctory glance at the map.

Whatever the case, the Excalibur Gondola has, at the very least, brought me
great satisfaction. Near the top of the lift, our cabin breaks
through the fog into a breathtaking panorama of blue sky and stunning
mountain vistas. As we continue skyward, I turn back to see the fog sitting on
the mountain village like a down comforter between the crossed legs of
Blackcomb & Whistler Mountains.

I hop off the gondola right onto the Excelerator quad. A quick warm-up run takes
me to the midpoint of the Blackcomb Gondola (a different gondola). On the way up
I make conversation
with a very nice couple, who inform me that they are the aunt & uncle of Cassie
and Darcy Sharpe, Canadian Olympians in freestyle skiing & snowboard,
respectively. Cassie is the reigning Olympic champion in skiing halfpipe, taking
gold at the 2018 games in Pyeongchang. *No big deal*.

They had planned to make the trip to Beijing to watch the games in person but
Covid had other ideas. The family decided to get together anyways in Whistler
where the Sharpes grew up & train. They are just on a sightseeing tour today,
and what a day it is for sightseeing. The dramatic peaks of the Coast Range
surround us, their jagged spines a structurally complex agglomeration of igneous
and metamorphic rocks formed from the Farallon & Kula oceanic plates slamming
into and subsiding beneath the North American plate. This was the same process
that began the Laramide Orogeny, the mountain building process that formed the
Rockies a few hundred miles to our East.

Another rider on the gondola mentions that he's going to meet his friends on the
Whistler side. They say the skiing is better over there today. I'll take that
deal, damn good deal.
After disembarking I make my way over to the Peak2Peak
gondola. I *really* should have planned this out better, I'm headed to my 4th
lift and all I have to show for it is one short run. *C'est la ski*.

The Peak2Peak gondola is unlike anything I've ever ridden. Instead of going *up*
a mountain, this particular cableway, as the name would suggest, is slung
across the deep valley between the peaks of Blackcomb and Whistler Mountains. The
cables form an enormous catenary suspended from two towering pylons on either
side. As we ride a kid, who I'd estimate to be in the 10-12 year-old range and
I'll just call Trevor, starts spouting facts about the gondola.

"The Peak2Peak gondola has the longest unsupported span in the world at 1.88
miles"

"The distance between the loading stations is 2.73 miles"

"It holds the record for highest point above the ground at 1,430 feet"

Everyone in the cabin looks at each other with a mixture of fascination,
curiosity, and mild
befuddlement. His parents, whose helping of befuddlement floweth over, ask him
how he knows all this, shooting a glance to the other riders that suggests
"he's not normally like this"

"It says it right up there"

We crane our necks to see a window near the top of the cabin that lists all the
facts & figures that our young tour guide was reciting. All the adults erupt into an
effervescent spate of laughter. It's the kind of laughter that makes friends out
of complete strangers. All the while Trevor, who everyone assumed was
some sort of Gondola Rain Man, just looks around confused. His face says, "what?
Did none of you grown-ups not see that right in front of your dumb faces?"

We sure didn't, Trev, we sure didn't.

The 11 minute ride across the valley is nothing short of spectacular. The views
are something you'd typically only be able to see in a helicopter. Perched over
1,400 feet above the valley floor, you could comfortably stack the Empire State
Building and the Statue of Liberty (without her pedestal) beneath our dangling
cabin. The magnificent peaks bestride a river of fog, flowing from the
Fitzsimmons to Whistler Valleys.

</figure>

11 minutes feel like 11 seconds and in no time we're at the top of Whistler. I
assess the situation and decide to venture up the valley for a few spins on the
Harmony chair. I then continue up the valley to an area known as the Symphony
Amphitheater, so called due to its breathtaking natural amphitheater-like
terrain. An enormous cirque drops into a copse of moderately pitched glades
ideal for cruisin'. This area is more sparsely populated than others and I'm
able to find some dynamite patches of snow.

</figure>

I venture back to the front side to tackle the Whistler Bowl, which looked like
it had some great lines. As I make my way around the face of the bowl
I stop dead in my tracks. The view unfolding before me is too incredible to
be believed. I take a few minutes to bask in all the glory that Whistler has to
offer before snapping a few amateur photographs and charging back down the
mountain. I ride up again, this time taking the Bagel Bowl, a bit to skier's
left of my last run.

</figure>

Once again the skiing is exceptional. This route takes me all the way back down
to the mountain village, where I decide to head back up Blackcomb since I didn't
have a chance to explore it this morning. The last few hours of the day
are spent cruising around above the treeline. Around 3:30 I head
back down to the mountain village, thirsty for an ice cold beer.

As I unstrap my gear I pop open SkiTracks to check my damage. I'm gobsmacked
when I see the number. 35,629 vertical feet, the most I've ever
skied by a pretty decent margin. Looking at the 3D map, however, I discover that
it's actually juiced up a bit. The app registered the big swinging arc of the
Peak2Peak gondola as a run & lift back up the other side of the valley. So 1,846'
of that are phony. The real value is 33,783', still my personal record.

Satisfied with a solid day's work I notice a place right next to the gondola
decked out in old-timey Western kitsch called The Longhorn Saloon. Well dadgum!
If I'm in luck it'll be customers there amenable to drawin' up in a circle
'round a deck a cards.

I find my way to a hightop in the bar area, "like me a spash a whiskey ta warsh
the traildust offen my gullet 'n keep m'singin' voice in fettle," I don't say
to the young lady who comes to take my order. "I'll take the Apr&egrave;s
Pilsner," I actually say as I take a visual inventory of the place. Not exactly
what you'd expect from a *saloon*. I mean, sure, they have all the gaudy
knickknacks you'd expect from a place that was seemingly designed by the garish
conglomerate who brought you Planet Hollywood. Faux weathered wood. Cowboy hats.
Horseshoes tacked to the walls. Fake longhorn steer mounts. Wax statues of
rough looking hombres with fabulous moustaches.

*You get the picture*.

But overwrought "Western" d&eacute;cor does not a saloon make. And this place is
a saloon in name only. I'd consider it a clerb with the requisite pieces of
flair to give it a saloon-ish patina. A DJ stands atop an elevated platform
"spinning" disharmonic collections of sounds that the kids apparently accept as
music these days. The scantily clad waitstaff are all exceptionally attractive
and disconcertingly young. The clientele skews bro-y. It's really a terrible
place.

As Ashton brings around my beer I notice a group of the aforementioned scantily
clad waitresses gathering at the door to the patio. And right as the clock
strikes 16:00 the DJ incomprehensibly screams into the microphone and the girls
sashay onto the patio with sparklers and bottles of champagne affixed to plastic
Tommy guns, spraying champagne into the air. *This is my nightmare*.

When I arrived and all the spots on the patio were occupied, I was slightly
disappointed I couldn't soak in the beautiful weather. Now I'm overjoyed to be
inside, looking through the glass at these animals like I'm at a zoo for
adolescents with raging hormones. This is what I get for patronizing any
establishment with "Longhorn" in the name.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">This is not my photo but from the front
	page of the saloon's website. A tragic collection of jabroneys.</figcaption>
</figure>

After the unfortunate bacchanal subsides, I waive Ashton over to my table.

"Hey, so are there any bars around here that aren't..... like this?"

"Ha yeah, this place gets a little cray"

"I thought I was coming to a 'saloon' where I could enjoy a whiskey and beer in
peace"

"Yeah, sorry about that, Whistler is kinda wild. I think your best bet is the
Irish pub across the street there, it's a little more low-key"

"Ok cool, I was there last night, I'll go check it out"

And with that I dump back my beer and stroll back to the bar I left no more than
18 hours ago. I open the door and an ear-to-ear smile careens across the bar and
affixes securely to my face. The two piece band at the front of the pub is
playing *The Chain* by Fleetwood Mac. Y'damn right. Ok this is more my speed.

I plant my boots on the bar rail and order up a Guinness. The woman next to me,
who introduces herself as Shannon, strikes up a conversation. She's a local
who's here to watch her boyfriend play guitar. Righteous. As the bartender
delivers my stout he regales us of the mayhem of
St Patrick's, when they went through 15 kegs of Guinness & 525 Irish car bombs.
They expect it to be bigger this year.

An older fella named Larry plops down next to us and starts in on jokes one
after the other. Bam. Bam. Bam. In the middle of one of his knee-slappers,
Shannon leans over and points to a plaque to my left. It's a quote attributed
to one Larry Ryan. I look at Shannon. I look at Larry. I look back at Shannon.

"Is he Larry Ryan?" I point to my new friend 

"Yup"

Suffice to say, Larry is well known 'round these parts. It turns out he's one of
the founding members of
The Old Goats, an informal fraternal order-cum-drinking club. The Goats
are such a part of the Dubh Linn Gate family they have their own
<a href="https://whistler.dubhlinngate.com/story/the-old-goats.php">page</a>
on the bar's website. The Goat's most hallowed responsibility is to update the
"Days Until St. Paddy's Day" sign every day. That and tell jokes.

While we're talking about the Goats, a woman at the end of the bar interjects,

"Hey! Whose dick do I gotta suck to get into The Old Goats club?"

"Well... mine," Larry smartly retorts.

God damn Larry, you ol' goat you!

I continue to carouse with my new band of miscreants, sharing pints and tall
tales. The workers in the hunger factory of my body, jealous of the thirst
division, order a small nacho platter (substituting tortilla chips for fried
potatoes of course, seeing as we're in an Irish pub). What subsequently arrives
to my bartop real estate is a grotesque bastardization of the
word "small." This heaping mound of sustenance would only be considered "small"
in the geologic sense. I could *easily* eat this for 3 separate meals and be
completely satiated. I can't remember ever being so incensed at the size of a meal.

And it was fucking delicious.

Dammit, Dubh Linn Gate, you've done it again.

I struggle to fill my belly with as much Irish nachos as I can before tapping
out and requesting a to-go box. My car will serve perfectly as a refrigerator
in this February Canadian climate. I finish my beer, & head back
to the pod to get cleaned up.

<p class="section-divider my-4">&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;</p>

I spill back out onto the wide arena of Whistler Village, devoid of my
malodorous ski stench, ready to take on the town. I stroll around a bit,
breathing in the cool refreshing air, nowhere to be, nowhere to go.

Somewhere along my aimless wanderings I find myself standing face to face with
a pub called Buffalo Bills. Well pardon my French but *fuck yeah*.

I hand my identification to the gentleman at the front and take the stairs down
to the pub.... aaaaaand I'm *immediately* disappointed. I thought this might be
a Western-style saloon, being named Buffalo Bills and all, but it's got more of
a 60s-era go-go bar vibe. Which is groovy in my book, baby, but there's nobody
here. Which makes the whole vibe super weird. But I can't just come to a bar
called Buffalo Bills and *not* order a drink.

  </div>
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">I'm not mad, Buffalo Bills, just disappointed</figcaption>
</figure>

Turns out I can.

I walk right back up them stairs, Buffalo Bills an unfortunate memory of what
could have been. It doesn't feel good. It doesn't feel like I'm trusting the
process. It doesn't feel like I'm doing my 1/11th.
As I'm questioning my dedication to the team, I walk across the path to a
nondescript joint called Tapley's Pub, where I'll snag a quick drink and
re-evaluate.

I sidle up to the bar & order a Backcountry Brewing Pale Ale. I start chatting
with the two young fellas to my left, who just moved here this season to work
at the hotels & ski as much as they can. Seems like a trend. As we're chatting
I see some goings on at one end of the bar and a steady stream of patrons
entering the tavern.

Before I can decide my next move I hear a bombastic, disembodied voice,
"Goooooooooooood evening ladies & gentlemen, weeeeeeeeelcome to Tapley's
Tuesday night bingooooooooooo!!!!!!"

Well, looks like I just stumbled into some bingo. Doug, the
bald & boisterous bingo-master, warms up the crowd as his minions pass out
bingo cards. One particular instruction catches my ear, "aaaaaand when I call
out O-69 the first people to come up here & 69 get a free shot of Jameson!"
Uhh, yeah.. sure.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">And Bingo was his name-o</figcaption>

Everyone gets settled in and Doug begins firing off numbers. He has the perfect
cadence and rollicking energy to call bingo for the rambunctious patrons of
Tapley's Pub. A few dobs here & there then Doug pulls a ball and you can see a
twinkle in his eye

"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SIIIIIIIIIIIIXXXXXXXTTTYYYYYYYY NIIIIIIIIIIINE!!!!!"

And like a flash a half dozen twosomes rush to the front of the bar, throwing
themselves into the sex number position with little to no regard for their
safety. One pair of particularly rowdy fellas do a standing 69. I almost fall
out of my barstool. This is the type of high-brow enterprise
that I know my solitary reader expects from me.

I stay for three rounds of Bingo and the resultant three rounds of 69in'. I
finish my Black's Pub Steamworks Flagship Northeast IPA before settling up with
the bartender & heading back to the pod, ready for another day on the mountain.

<p class="section-divider my-4">&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;</p>

The next morning I roll out of my pod & strap on m'toolbelt headed back up to
the mountain.

This time I head up the Whistler gondola, a much more expeditious method of
travel than the Excalibur Gondola-Excelerator Express-Blackcomb Gondola route.
I repeat my Harmony-Symphony-Whistler Bowl route from yesterday and it rips just
as hard today. My ultimate goal for the day, however, is the Blackcomb Glacier. 

To reach the glacier I'll need to, obviously, traverse over to the Blackcomb
side. To the Peak2Peak I go, still astounded by the scale of the conveyance
and the outrageous views. From the P2P I take the Glacier Express to the
Showcase T-Bar. At the top of the T-Bar I unstrap the planks and hoof it about
5-10 minutes up a steepish snowpack to the top of the glacier. And by god it is
glorious. I take a moment to enjoy the scenery before re-engaging the send
sticks and dropping into the glacier.

</figure>

The snow is a bit crunchy but the wide open expanse of the glacier is sheer
bliss. About halfway down I see dozens of pairs of skis and snowboards lined up
along the right side of the run. I scoot over to investigate what all the
ruckus is about and find heaps of people in, on, and around the Blackcomb
Glacier Ice Cave. I read about the cave but honestly had forgotten about it.
The deep blue of the glacial ice creates a pleasing aura that's only broken by
groups trying to pose for the *perfect* picture.

The rest of the run is a pretty mellow cruise back around the front. From here
I make my way over to the 7th Heaven area, the only section
of the resort I haven't skied yet. This is the mirror image to Symphony &
Harmony, some nice runs in the valley towards
Fitzsimmons Creek. This area closes at 2:30 so I'm only able to take two runs
before heading back to the main area. I briefly consider
taking the P2P back over to Whistler but decide to just jaunt around Blackcomb
the last few hours of the day.

I end the day with 24,807 feet of vertical, a more modest tally but still a solid
day in my book. Damn near 60k vertical feet in two days is *prettay prettay
prettay* good if you ask me. I was able to essentially see everything both
mountains had to offer and next time around (there will most definitely be a
next time around, this place is incredible) I'll have a much better gameplan.

I'm pretty beat from two big days of skiing and the night is much more mellow. I
have a 6 hour drive ahead of me tomorrow so it's best that I turn in early
anyways.

<h4 class="article-subheader">BC Crossing</h4>

Another day, another drive. Today we head East, right up to the border of
Alberta. My destination is Revelstoke, a little town in the Canadian Rockies.
The ski area, Revelstoke Mountain Resort, is a relative newcomer on the skiing
scene, only opening in 2007. The mountain boasts the largest vertical descent
(5,620 ft) and longest run (8.3 miles) in North America.

This stretch of the trip has always been tentative, filed under the heading of
"weather-permitting" in the planning committee's documents. Fortunately
the weather is outstanding & the roads are clear. I
load up the car & grab a coffee before bidding farewell to Whistler.
The road out of town winds through some of the most spectacular mountain
vistas I've ever experienced. The extent of the colossal, rugged peaks leaves me
in a perpetual state of awe. About 2 hours from Whistler I come upon a lake
of an indescribable turquoise color nestled between two spines of jagged peaks.
I find a parking area overlooking the lake and pull off to get a better view.

</figure>

As I'm basking in the beauty of the lake & surrounding landscape I notice a
slightly worn trail that appears to head down to the water. Hell I ain't in no
rush, let's go for a little hike. I head down the impromptu trail, under
branches, through thickets, and over boulders. As I reach the bottom I see a
road that goes right along the lake, a much easier journey to get exactly where
I am now. Oh well, I could use a little exercise to break up the monotonous 
day's measure of hoof clops.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Not really much of a trail, more of a

I walk out to the water, past a dock that's used for summer recreatin'. The
vibrant water laps calmly upon the shore, a tranquil juxtaposition to the
imposing peaks on either side. I dip my hand in the mineral-laden water, a
refreshing sensation for body and spirit alike.

Once I've had my fill of the crisp mountain air and breathtaking scenery I hike
back up to the car to continue my journey.

</figure>

As I complete my bifurcation of the Coast Range, temperate rainforests make way
for the arid expanses of the Interior Plateau.
I catch the only road in Canada outside the little town of Cache
Creek and follow it another 4 hours through the towns of Kamloops, Copper Creek,
and Salmon Arm. As I drive, Waze converts the speed limits from metric to
Imperial, leading to silly situations where I'm prohibited by law to exceed
37 or 41 mph. The fastest I can go on most highways is 62.

As I reach the western edge of the Canadian Rockies the sun begins to set. An
hour later I pull into town just as a light dusting of snow begins to fall. I
find my way to the Grizz Hotel, a no-frills accommodation with a great location
and reasonable rate. I check in and head out on foot to explore. Revy, as it's
commonly known, sits on the banks of the headwaters of the
<a href="/traveler/2021_04-ski_trip/wp/day_6.html">Columbia River</a>, just
after the mighty confluence makes a U-turn at Kinbasket Lake & begins its long,
southwesterly push to the Pacific. The town was founded in the 1880s
as a mining outpost as the tracks of the Canadian Pacific Railway were laid. It
takes its name from Lord Revelstoke, a British banker who saved the
railroad from insolvency.

I pop into the Craft Bierhaus for a pint and some vittles. I'm seated at a long
table next to a group of Texans who are in town for a bit of heli-skiing. The
mind-boggling scale of the mountains of British Columbia, coupled with its
relative lack of commercial development, make it an ideal place for
chopper-based alpine adventures.
I've seen more outfits offering heli-skiing in the few days I've been in BC than
I have in my entire skiing career.

The local guide, who will be chaperoning the group tomorrow, tells us about the
mayhem that ensued from the monster storm that rolled through in December. He
had himself a nice little side hustle pulling out stuck vehicles, sometimes
dozens in a single day. He claims he once fastened a tow rope to a marooned
automobile, tied the other end to a tree, and felled the tree with a chainsaw
to free the stuck vehicle (I'm still dubious as to the veracity of this claim).

As I peruse the menu I quickly determine that I'll just enjoy a beer here &
enjoy my supper elsewhere. This is far too fancy (and expensive) for my liking
so I suck back a Beautiful Pale from Strathcona Beer Co. before bidding my new
friends adieu. I wander around for a few blocks before stumbling upon a place
called the Village Idiot Bar & Grill. That sounds more my speed. I belly up to
the bar and order a Revelstoke Lager from Mt Begbie Brewing. I'm delighted as I
scan the menu to see they offer poutine. This is my 4th day in Canada and I have
yet to poutine (I see no reason why we can't use poutine as a verb). This sad
state of affairs needs to be rectified immediately.

And so it was.

</figure>

I strike up a conversation with a very nice Austrian couple, who are taking a
ski vacation to Canada. I wonder why in the hell anyone would leave the *Alps* to
go skiing but they just wanted to try something different. I guess
that's just the human condition.

I finish up my poutine and guzzle another beer for good measure. Then it's
back to the Grizz for a little shuteye.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Revelstoked</h4>

I arise to overcast skies and an inch or two of fresh snow. I pack my gear and
make the short drive to the mountain. The resort is implementing a strict
vaccine policy so the first time up the gondola I flash my vax card to prove
that I am the proud owner of a Bill-Gates-5G-microchip-tracking-device.

The gondola takes me about halfway up the hill where I jump on the Stoke
chair to the top. I'm hoping to try out some of the runs off Verigo Ridge & the
North Bowl, however on my way up Stoke I realize that may not happen. The
lift pierces into a layer of fog thicker than a bowl of oatmeal. By the time we
reach the top I can't see 10 yards in front of me. If I knew the mountain I might
hike up to the aforementioned runs, but as it stands I'll just take an easier way
down, seeing as I can't... see.

I take two runs down from the top, at which point I reluctantly admit I'm not
enjoying this. I may have better luck on the Ripper chair on the other side of
the mountain, which appears to terminate lower on the mountain, possibly staying
below the fog line. The next time down I venture a little
farther afield, towards the Separate Reality Bowl to skier's right. This run
would have ripped on a clear day but today it's just this side of miserable.
I essentially have to make a turn, stop, check my line, next turn, stop, repeat.
Not great, Bob.

I eventually matriculate myself down the hill & over to Ripper. As expected this
lift stays below the fog line for the most part and
I'm able to get some solid runs in over here. Around lunchtime I head back down
to the base for a quick bite. The fog seems to have let up a bit so I venture
back to to the top. Feeling a bit sporting I decide to head straight down, top
to bottom, all 5,620' of vert.

I drop into Snow Rodeo and immediately feel the burn. The run is steep,
bumpy, and chopped up with fresh powder. I make it a decent way down the top
section before I need to stop & catch my breath. But as Revy sees it, we've
only just begun. This is just the first of many, *many* breaks. As I descend, the
number of turns I'm able to link between pit stops rapidly diminishes. At one
point I just sit down on the side of the run for a few minutes to remind myself
that I'm \*having fun\*. Each time I reach a crest that *has* to be the final
descent to the lodge I'm chagrined to see another long stretch of piste
grinning like a Cheshire Cat through snow white teeth made of moguls the size
of Volkswagens.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">At least the view was nice</figcaption>
</figure>

I finally, mercifully, painfully, make it to the bottom. And I'm absolutely gassed.
According to SkiTracks it took me 36 minutes. For context, the longest run I
took during all 60,000 vertical feet of Whistler was *15 and a half minutes*.
From this point forward I shall dedicate my life to finding the roughest,
toughest, rowdiest bull on the planet just so I can name him **Revelstoke**.
Ain't no cowboy gonna ride that surly sunofabitch.

After all that I'm ready to call it a day. But seeing as I came all the way to
the scene of the longest ski run in North America, I might as well ride the
longest ski run in North America. For no other reason than
to say I did. Fortunately for my legs it's an easy-peasy green all the way down.

I head back up to the top and get a hankerin' for some Fleetwood Mac. Right as I
slide off the chairlift I pipe *Rumours* into my headphones, the perfect vibe
for a nice, easy cruise down the Last Spike. 8.3 miles of wide switchbacks with
a cool Canadian breeze on my face and Stevie Nicks in my ears. The only danger is
evading the toddlers & the Jerrys.

At the bottom I check SkiTracks, eager to see how long it took to ride the
longest ski run in North America. To my utter disappointment, it appears the app
went haywire & didn't record the run.

*You can't be serious!!*

As I'm lamenting this technological travesty I hear John
McVie's funky bass line in the outro of *The Chain* fade into Mick Fleetwood's
high hat and the groovy stylings of Lindsey Buckingham's Fender Stratocaster in
the opening of *You Make Loving Fun*. Well... now hold on just a second... We
may be able to salvage this whole situation... If I add up the length of all
the songs up to & including *The Chain*... I just may be able to back myself
into how long it took me to ride the longest ski run in North America.

So let's see here, if we add it all up, convert the minutes to seconds, carry
the two.... We come in just few seconds short of 25 minutes. Hot damn.

*Rumours* will **never, ever** disappoint me.

Smitten with my Fleetwood fortune I head back to the car with a jaunty gait
reserved only for those who are blissfully unaware of their surroundings. I
strip my gear and hit the road, continuing my eastward journey into the province
of Alberta. My destination is Lake Louise, a glacial lake
within Banff National Park named for Queen Victoria's fourth daughter. By all
accounts the lake epitomizes beauty and splendor; the only reason I'm heading
there is the effusive praise I've heard from people who have been there.

Two and a half hours of driving through the Canadian Rockies brings me to the
Hostelling International Lake Louise Alpine Centre. I check in and drop my bags
in the room. The common areas are pretty desolate, most guests presumably in the
middle of supper. I walk about a mile to town, which is eerily dead. I find a
single tavern that's open and belly up to the bar for an ice cold Labatt.

I overhear a couple blue collar fellas at the end of the bar complaining about
the
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/07/americas/canada-covid-protest-explainer/index.html">trucker strike</a> going on at the border.

"Nobody wants to work these days, they come up with all these bullshit excuses
and now I gotta deal with these assholes blocking the border."

"No shit, I heard someone out there interviewing the truckers and none of them
knew why they were striking, they just wanted to weasel their lazy asses out of
working."

It should go without saying that I keep my current employment status to myself.

I polish off another beer before heading back to the lodging. I'm in bed at a
reasonable hour, the last night of my Canadian sojourn.

<p class="section-divider my-4">&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;</p>

I arise the next morning to fresh snow falling from the sky. Of course on the
day I'm not even planning to ski we're getting fresh pow. I load up the car and
make the short drive to the lake.

As I ramble through the snow covered pines to the shores of Lake Louise the word
"disappointed" doesn't begin to describe my feelings. I'm sure the lake
is stunning - every photo I have seen proves as much - however the low overcast
skies and falling snow completely obscure the view. I drove all the way here
for essentially the same view you'd get in a steamy sauna. A
handful of people are skating on the frozen lake and I briefly consider
strapping on my new skates that I commandeered from my cousin but think better
of it. The non-zero probability that I fall and break a bone is a strong enough
deterrent to keep my hiking boots on.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">You vs the lake she tells you not to worry
  about</figcaption>
</figure>

I had planned to hike up to a scenic viewpoint along the mountains that flank
the lake but there's no point now. So I trudge back to the car, reminding myself
that all things considered I am in no condition to complain. If a crummy view of
Lake Louise is the worst thing to happen to me on this trip I'd say that's a
resounding success. Just gotta think positive.

Back to the car and I hit the road, headed south to Schweitzer Mountain
Resort in Sandpoint, ID. As I
descend into the Columbia River Valley the snow turns to a light drizzle. I'm
minding my business on the Banff-Windermere Highway when all of a sudden I see
a sign that reads "Radium Hot Springs Parking Next Left." Well, now what's all
that about?

I take the sign's recommendation and bang a larry into the parking lot. I see
groups of people loading bathing suits and beach towels into bags. Whelp, when in
Rome. I shove a pair of swim trunks and a towel into a bag and walk towards a
stone building built into the side of a mountain. The complex, built in 1951
after the original facility burned down, houses two large pools - a hot soaking
pool that's fed by the mineral hot springs that run below the facility, and a
cold water lap pool.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Let's have a soak</figcaption>
</figure>

As I walk up to the complex I see a line forming outside the door. Looks like
we have about 15 minutes before the 10:30 opening time. I spend the time watching
a mountain goat scrambling about on the cliffs above. By the time the gates open
the crowd has swelled to over 100 by my best guesstimate. I enter the facility
& pay the $8 for a single entry pass. I pop on my trunks in the changing room
and make my way out to the hot pool.

The steamy, mineral water soothes achy muscles, overworked from weeks of skiing.
The hot springs were named for the trace amounts of radon found in the water, a
decay byproduct of radium. I park myself on a nice spot on the ledge that runs
around the outside of the pool. While I'm enjoying the soak a pickup
truck drives by, gives two quick honks and hollers "NO PEEIN' IN THE POOL."
Everyone in the pool enjoys a hearty chuckle.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Relaxation station</figcaption>
</figure>

I soak for about half an hour before rinsing off and heading back to the car.
It's about another 2.5 hours of driving through the Columbia and Kootenay River
Valleys when I reach the bridge on Canadian Highway 95 across the Moyie River.
As I come upon the bridge I see my entire
lane across the span is blocked by trucks, cars, vans, and bogans "protesting."
As the grumpy old man stated at the bar last night, what they are protesting I'm
sure they don't know. 

Even if they did have a sound reason to assert their rights to assembly,
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/opinions/canadian-trucker-protest-absurdity-everyday-life-el-sayed/index.html">which
they don't</a>, inconsequential wouldn't even begin to describe the effect of
blocking the 400 daily vehicles that pass through the Eastport-Kingsgate border
crossing. There are more cars parked on the side of the road than that. You can
call it a protest, but 'round my parts they call this a tailgate. 

The supposedly aggrieved revelers stretch on for a half mile, an unbroken line of maple
leaf flags, "Fuck Trudeau" signs, fully stocked coolers, and amateur pitmasters
manning their grills. For a minute I'm worried that I won't be able to cross,
but at the very last possible moment I see a Mountie overseeing a
gap in the line to allow ingress & egress. I give the public servant a wave that
says "thank you for your service" and a look that says "my condolences for
having to put up with these dipshits."

I pull up to the customs booth where a cheery gentleman greets me. He asks all
the usual questions & when I tell him that I have food in the car he tells me
to pull into a stall by the customs building and wait inside. *Oy vey*, this
charade again.

When I enter the customs house the dour customs agent behind the desk begins
grilling me with the autocratic air of an over-officious jerk. He's sure that
the tiny sliver of authority he wields on the border of northern Idaho confers
upon him a godlike status, The Defender of the Free World. When I tell him that
I have a bag of oranges in the car he becomes personally incensed to a degree
that you'd have thought I told him I was toting a kilo of cocaine across the
border.

"How many oranges"

"I don't know, a bag's worth"

"You mean to tell me you are trying to cross the border without knowing what you
have in your car"

"I have a bag of oranges"

"Where did you get the oranges?"

"Oklahoma"

He *really* wasn't expecting that. The confusion only seems to enrage him more,
a predictable reaction from an obtuse make & model of *Homo sapiens* rubbing his
full complement of two neurons together too vigorously.

With that he snatches my keys off the counter and storms out to my car in a
huff. I take a seat on one of the folding chairs in the lobby, ready to get the
hell out of here.

15 minutes later Barney Fife struts back in with the bag of oranges and a smirk
like he just nabbed El Chapo.

"Do you have a receipt for these?"

"No"

"Well I'm going to have to take them"

"Yeah sure whatever"

He then proceeds to condescendingly lecture me about various types of
citrus-borne diseases that necessitate the prohibition of any and all types of
citrus fruits into the US. I resist the urge to insolently ask about the
lack of concern for human-borne diseases given the fact that I needed not
provide any Covid-related documentation to cross the border. I just want to get
this over with.

He hands me a sheet that lists all the items that are barred from crossing the
border and switches to a good cop routine.

"I just want to make sure you know the regulations," he says in a concerned
father tone. "I'm going to issue you a warning for the oranges, check this sheet
next time you plan to cross the border for any items that may not be allowed.
When in doubt throw it out."

Ok I made up that last sentence. But I think it's pretty good.

He hands me back the keys and I feign gratitude for his leniency. The only thing
that kept me from consecutive life sentences for each of the half dozen oranges
is his boundless benevolence. Saved from a life behind bars. All praise His mercy!

I hop back in the car, eager to put that whole episode in my rearview. I pull
out of the border patrol station, continuing my journey south. I see a sign up
ahead that puts a grin on my face from ear to ear

"Speed Limit 60 MPH."

Damn glad to see you again.
