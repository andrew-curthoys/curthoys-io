<h4 class="article-subheader">Are you sure that's the right way?</h4>
"Pretty sure... it's what the map on AllTrails says"

I dunno, that looks like a cliff

"I think there's a trail that wraps around"

That wraps around a cliff??

"There's only one way to find out"

Halfway up Mt Prest we've found ourselves in quite a pickle. Standing on the
precipice of what would appear to be a cliff our otherwise trusty trail has
winnowed down to a slender footpath perched atop a cliff hugging the left side
of Prest's craggy mass (if you told me that Cliff Pickle was a NASCAR
driver in the 1970s I'd believe you. Hell I'd probably think you were lying if
you told me Cliff Pickle wasn't a NASCAR driver in the 1970s).

But no adventure story is complete without a harrowing test of mettle:

Ahab vs Moby Dick

Hercules vs the Hydra

Atreyu vs the Nothing


Me vs a short narrative

<h4 class="article-subheader">Mountain Climbers</h4>


That morning we rose our heads in the Norwegian fjordtown of Fl&aring;m.

The trailhead for our hike sits above the town of Aurland, a stone's throw from
our home base in Fl&aring;m. As our Toyota moseys through town Jill recognizes a
landmark from her research,

"Oh! Marianne Bakery! I read about this place, they are supposed to
have amazing cinnamon rolls!"

In silent unison the entire car approves Jill's motion to adjourn
for cinnamon rolls and Michael smoothly pulls into a parking space next to the
bakery. 10 minutes later we are back on the road scarfing down
a round of spiced pastries that exceed even Jill's prodigious expectations. 
Unlike the gooey, hyperglycemic blobs of masonry paste that we're accustomed to,
the *Kanelboller* dispense with the goo and go all in on nutmeg, cardamon,
allspice, and, of course, the namesake cinnamon. It's delicious but in a way
that removes the "guilty" from guilty pleasure; a perfect jolt of delectable
carbs to fuel us on our hike.

As we pull out of town it's impossible to ignore the beauty of our 

Out the left side of the Toyota, unfurled to our 10 o'clock as far as the eye
can see stretches the tranquil waters of the *Aurlandsfjord*. The entirety of
our right flank is shadowed by an aval ridge of viridescent highlands, keeping
an austere watch over the fjord below.

Straight ahead stands Mt Prest; the object of they day's conquest.

As we begin the upward progression of our journey to the trailhead our paved
trail begins losing mass; narrowing as the waistline of a flatlander beginning a
mountain climbing regimen. Eventually we find ourselves on a one-lane road,
and when I say one-lane I mean *ONE* lane. Uphill and downhill traffic must
manage the single lane in a game of mountainside chicken. Luckily we have found
ourselves in the middle of an impromptu caravan of RVs and motorcycles; a
desirable location where we
can simply *go with the flow*. Our fearless leader at the front is tasked with
the delicate dance of negotiating oncoming traffic.

Half an hour and a dozen switchbacks later we find ourselves at the trailhead.
As we unload the car we assess the weather to gauge our wardrobe selections.
The sun is poking through mottled clouds, the temperature is hovering right in
the gray area between shortsleeves and long. We're set to climb 2,000 vertical
feet over the course two miles. We will certainly work up a sweat
on the hike but that will be countered by the cooler temperatures on the
mountain. Will the sun stay out? Is it windy up there?

Sufficiently geared up, we hit the trail. The first half mile of the hike takes
us up a mild grade to the top of a bluff overlooking the *Sognefjord*. If this
was the extent of the hike I'd be thrilled. From even this lower station I'm
afforded what is almost certainly the most stunning view I've ever seen in my
life.

While soaking in the surroundings I feel the ominous presence of a dark slab of
metamorphic rock looming over my right shoulder. I turn 'round, crane my neck,
and ponder, we couldn't possibly be going *all the way up there*???

If we were standing on the pavement of 5th Avenue in New York City the top of
this mountain
would look down on the spire of the Empire State Building. It seems an
insurmountable task; a hopeless fight against the relentless tug of gravity.

But we set off anyway,

The final ascent tracks the moderate pitch of the mountain's shoulder. Patches
of small but vibrant flowers line the path, sparkles of yellows, reds, and pinks
hidden within the mottled green mats of dewy moss. Small fields of snow
luxuriate in shady alcoves, stubbornly clinging to their crystalline structure.

As we reach Mt Prest's plateaued summit the ground sinks beneath our hiking
boots, waterlogged from the winter's snowpack.

the weather starts to change. The scattered clouds initiate a descattering
maneuver, enveloping our fjordview behind the veil of a misty fog. Our
lofty kingdom enveloped by a damp grey specter.

Thankfully our chagrin is short lived - as quickly as it came the fog is gone,
sliced into ghostly ribbons of ethereal vapor. Its final memory floating on wispy
tendrils carried away by the dying breaths of the North Atlantic jet stream.

Goat escape


<h4 class="article-subheader">Cruisin'</h4>
The next morning project leader Jill has planned a sightseeing cruise to supplement to our
land-based fjord observations. Unfortunately we're not the only
ones with the idea...

During our mountaineering escapades yesterday we spotted a spec upon the fjord
not much larger than a grain of rice. If it weren't for its slender
emerald tail of churned seawater it likely would have been imperceptible.
Unfortunately that miniscule grain of rice was the
*MV Brittania*, the flagship of P&O Cruises of Southampton, UK.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Go find another fjord!</figcaption>
</figure>

Standing as tall as a 20 story building and as long as three-and-a-half football
fields, the *Brittania*'s 4000 passengers outnumber the permanent residents of
Fl&aring;m 10 to 1.

According to the *Brittania*'s website their *passengers-to-space-ratio* is 33.
It does not specify units. I'm unsure if this is good. Is *PTSR* a selling
point among cruise ships?

As we stroll into town this lovely Norwegian summer morning we're greeted with
an altogether different experience than the charming fjordtown we roamed
yesterday. Gone is the carefree chatter fluttering from charming sidewalk cafes.
In are torpid droves of cruisepeople in gauche Norwegian graphic t-shirts
distending cafe queues and blocking sidewalks like atherosclerotic plaque.

Swimming against the roiling sea of humanity belched upon the avenues of Fl&aring;m
we finally manage to procure a coffee in a paper cup and a cold pastry. We have
30 minutes till our vessel begins embarking but the line to board has already
begun swelling like a flight to Orlando when they announce boarding zone 1.
Unfortunately we decide to join the procession lest we are stuck with an
undesirable vantage. At least we have some stunning views to distract us from
the inane prattle of cruise ship rewards point hacks.

Half an hour later a stressed out teenager mercifully drops the rope to begin a
slow plodding of humanity onto the *Future of the Fjords*, the first
all-electric carbon fiber vessel in the world. With two 600 horsepower engines
powered by an 1800 kWh battery pack the *Future* can cruise at a breezy 16 knots
for 40 nautical miles on a single charge. To put that into a little perspective
(making some rough assumptions on average car gas tank size and EV battery pack
capacity) that's roughly equivalent to 1000 gallons of gasoline.

We find a good spot on the top deck with a starboard vantage and without even
realizing it we're 100 yards from the dock. The *Future of the Fjords* is so
smooth and quiet her motion is indiscernible. Gliding across the fjord at a
brisk clip without the rumble
of a diesel engine, not to mention the noxious fumes,

Electric propulsion is the only way to see the fjords.

Half an hour into our sail we follow the fjord's leftward jaunt in the hulking
shadow of Mt Prest. If you squint just right you can see the cairn where we
signed the logbook yesterday. of sailing down a corridor of tranquil waters enveloped
by verdant cliffs

After 10 nautical miles of more of the same we reach a fork in the fjord.
Finally something to get excited about. Right
takes you up the main leg of the *Aurlandsfjord*, a tributary of the mighty
*Sognefjord*, where, if you hang a left and cruise for 50 more miles, you hit
the open ocean. For myriad reasons, including the presumed lack of ferry
charging infrastructure on the fjord, we veer left, down the
*N&aelig;r&oslash;yfjord*. This decision suits us, seeing as this is the the
fjord-ward extension of the *Valley of the Waterfalls*, and most excitingly,
the inspiration for Arendelle in *Frozen*.

After our cruise we have a few hours to kill before our 6:30 PM reservation on
the Fl&aring;m Railway. Jill found a reasonable hike within walking distance so
we strap on our hikin' boots and set off southbound from town. We stroll along
the Nedre Brekkevegan river bestride bucolic farms
flanked by towering cliffs blanketed with trees.

A mile south of town we veer right through a cut in the vegetation onto a
well-trod path ascending yet another of Norway's innumerable mountains. The
length of the trail is littered with the heaving breaths of ambitious decisions
made by cruise-ship passengers whose collective fitness level skews towards couch
potato. The unrelenting mid-summer sun intensifies the collective distress;
I pop my tarp.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Trains Are So Cool, Part Deux</h4>
The 12-mile Fl&aring;m Railway has been described as "the most
beautiful train journey in the world". Starting at Fl&aring;m, the railway
winds 2,841 vertical feet up the Halling Valley to the cozy town of Myrdal.

As the electric beast begins its skyward journey we quickly realize that we
picked the wrong side of the train. Not to say this side is bad, it's just all
the best bits are out the windows across the aisle where two surly
septuagenarian women haughtily occupy one third of the inventory of a 6-seat alcove.

The train slithers its way up the gorge, clinging to the jagged
canyon walls like a sure-footed Norwegian coastal goat. The windows slide down.
Do we take advantage? We do

Halfway through the
journey the conductor announces over the intercom that we will be making a
5-minute sightseeing stop at the Kjosfossen waterfall. Our trusty ferric goat
rumbles to a stop at the base of the falls where we spill out of car 7 onto a
wide platform with a striking view of the water feature.

The cascading torrents of Kjosfossen slalom 300 feet down a steep ravine like an
alpine skier navigating a mogul field. The blissful cerulean sky provides the
perfect backdrop to appreciate the wonder of nature.

Trains are so cool because you can talk about the steepness of a hill like "18

* Foss hike

AllTrails insists
it's a trail, but as we would discover throughout this trip Norwegians are much
more serious about hiking than we. A Norwegian "easy" will work up a serious
lather; a Norwegian "moderate" will test your limits; a Norwegian "hard"
will find me at the bar wishing godspeed to the intrepid hikers.

. At this
point all conversation ceases while our expedition navigates the 50 yard
tightrope maneuver, every ounce of concentration devoted to the
precise placement of every step, grabbing hold to the edge of the cliff like
Jimmy Stewart in *Vertigo*.
