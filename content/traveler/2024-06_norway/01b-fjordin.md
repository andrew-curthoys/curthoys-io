The trailhead for our hike sits above the town of Aurland, a stone's throw down
the road from Fl&aring;m. As our Toyota moseys through town Jill recognizes a
landmark from her research,

"Oh! Marianne Bakery! I remember reading about this place, they are supposed to
have amazing cinnamon rolls!"

In silent unison the entire car approves Jill's motion to adjourn
for cinnamon rolls and Michael smoothly pulls into a parking space across the
street from the bakery. 10 minutes later we are back on the road scarfing down
a round of spiced pastries that exceed even Jill's prodigious expectations. 
Unlike the gooey, hyperglycemic blobs of masonry paste that we're accustomed to,
the *Kanelboller* dispense with the goo and go all in on nutmeg, cardamon,
allspice, and, of course, the namesake cinnamon.

The drive to the trailhead is up a one-lane switchback road overlooking Aurland.
And when I say one-lane I mean *ONE* lane. Uphill and downhill traffic must
manage the single lane in a game of mountainside chicken. We have found ourselves
in the middle of a caravan of RVs and motorcycles, a desirable spot where we
can simply *go with the flow*. Our fearless leader at the front is tasked with
the delicate dance of negotiating oncoming traffic.

Half an hour and a dozen switchbacks later we find ourselves at the trailhead.
As we unload the car we assess the weather to gauge our wardrobe selections.
The sun is poking through mottled clouds, the temperature is hovering right in
the gray area between shortsleeves and long. We're set to climb 2,000 vertical
feet over the course of a mile and three-quarters. We will certainly work up a sweat
on the hike but that will be countered by the cooler temperatures on the
mountain. Will the sun stay out? Is it windy up there?

Sufficiently geared up, we hit the trail. The first half mile of the hike takes
us up a mild grade to the top of a bluff overlooking the *Sognefjord*. If this
was the extent of the hike I'd be thrilled. From even this lower station I'm
afforded what is almost certainly the most stunning view I've ever seen in my
life.

While soaking in the surroundings I feel the ominous presence of a dark slab of
metamorphic rock looming over my right shoulder. I turn round and crane my neck,
we couldn't possibly be going *all the way up there*???

1,500 feet into the cerulean Norwegian sky. If we were standing on the pavement
on 5th Avenue the top of this mountain would look down of the tip of the
spire of the Empire State Building. It looks an
insurmountable task; a hopeless fight against the relentless tug of gravity.

No adventure story is complete without a harrowing test of mettle - ours occurs
halfway through the hike when the trail winnows down to a slender footpath
perched atop a cliff hugging the left side of the craggy mass. At this
point all conversation ceases while our expedition navigates the 50 yard
tightrope maneuver, every ounce of concentration devoted to the
precise placement of every step, grabbing hold to the edge of the cliff like
Jimmy Stewart in *Vertigo*.

The final ascent tracks the moderate pitch of the mountain's shoulder. Patches
of small, vibrant flowers line the path, explosions of yellows, reds, and pinks
spackle the mottled green of the dewy moss. Small fields of snow luxuriate in
shady alcoves, stubbornly clinging to their crystalline structure.

The plateaued summit of Mt Prest sinks beneath our hiking boots, waterlogged
from the winter's snowpack.

A cairn stands erect at the R&oslash;yrgrind viewpoint, standing guard over the
Aurlandsfjord. We snap a few photos at the monument before signing the logbook.

While gazing out over the 
<a href="/traveler/2023_05-scandinavia/05-oslo_nature.html?id=fjord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glacially eroded sea inlet trough</a>
the weather starts to change. The scattered clouds begin a descattering
maneuver, enveloping the view of the fjord behind the veil of a misty fog. Our
lofty kingdom enveloped by a damp grey specter.

Thankfully our chagrin is short lived; as quickly as it came it's gone,
sliced into ghostly ribbons of ethereal vapor. Its final memory wispy
tendrils carried away by the terminal gasp of the North Atlantic jet stream.




<h4 class="article-subheader">Cruisin'</h4>
The morning after our mountaineering escapades Jill has procured passage on a
sightseeing cruise through the fjords. Unfortunately so too have hordes of
visitors aboard the *MV Brittania*, a cruise ship that snuck into port overnight
much to our chagrin.

According to the *Brittania*'s website their *passengers-to-space-ratio* is 33.
It does not specify units. Since this is the first cruise ship website I've
had the pleasure of visiting I'm unsure if that's a good number. Is that a
selling point among cruise lines? *Climb aboard the luxurious USS Dysentery with
an industry leading 25 passengers-to-space-ratio! USS Dysentery. Escape the smell.*



Bright and early we hop aboard the *Future of the Fjords*, the first
all-electric carbon fiber vessel in the world. With two 600 horsepower engines
powered by an 1800 kWh battery pack the *Future* can cruise at a breezy 16 knots
for 40 nautical miles on a single charge. To put that into a little perspective,
making some rough assumptions on average car gas tank size and EV battery pack
capacity that's roughly equivalent to 1000 gallons of gasoline.

As we're standing on the deck navigating the roiling sea of humanity belched
upon Fl&aring;m by the *Brittania*

Her 4000 passengers have the permanent residents of Fl&aring;m
outnumbered 10 to 1. Much to their chagrin one would presume.

*Brittania* 


After our cruise we have a few hours to kill before our 6:30 PM reservation on
the Fl&aring;m Railway. Jill found a reasonable hike within walking distance so
we strap on our hikin' boots and set off southbound from town. We stroll along
the Nedre Brekkevegan river bestride bucolic farms
flanked by towering tree-covered cliffs.

A mile south of town we veer right through a cut in the vegetation onto a
well-trod path ascending yet another of Norway's innumerable mountains. The
length of the trail is littered with the heaving breaths of ambitious decisions
made by cruise-ship passengers whose collective fitness level skews towards couch
potato. The unrelenting mid-summer sun intensifies the collective distress;
I pop my tarp.




<h4 class="article-subheader">Trains Are So Cool, Part Deux</h4>
The 12-mile Fl&aring;m Railway has been described as "the most
beautiful train journey in the world". Starting at Fl&aring;m, the railway
winds 2,841 vertical feet up the Halling Valley to the cozy town of Myrdal.

As the electric beast begins its skyward journey we quickly realize that we
picked the wrong side of the train. Not to say this side is bad, it's just all
the best bits are out the windows across the aisle where two surly
septuagenarian women haughtily occupy one third of the inventory of a 6-seat alcove.



Trains are so cool because you can talk about the steepness of a hill like "18
in 1" and say things like "rolling stock".
