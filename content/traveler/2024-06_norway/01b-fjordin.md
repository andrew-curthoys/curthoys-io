The trailhead for our hike sits above the town of Aurland, a stone's throw down
the road from Fl&aring;m. As our Toyota moseys through town Jill recognizes a
landmark from her research,

"Oh! Marianne Bakery! I remember reading about this place, they are supposed to
have amazing cinnamon rolls!"

In silent unison the entire car approves Jill's motion to adjourn
for cinnamon rolls and Michael smoothly pulls into a parking space across the
street from the bakery. 10 minutes later we are back on the road scarfing down
a round of spiced pastries that exceed even Jill's prodigious expectations. 
Unlike the gooey, hyperglycemic blobs of masonry paste that we're accustomed to,
the *Kanelboller* dispense with the goo and go all in on nutmeg, cardamon,
allspice, and, of course, the namesake cinnamon.

The drive to the trailhead is up a one-lane switchback road overlooking Aurland.
And when I say one-lane I mean *ONE* lane. Uphill and downhill traffic must
manage the single lane in a game of mountainside chicken. We have found ourselves
in the middle of a caravan of RVs and motorcycles, a desirable spot where we
can simply *go with the flow*. Our fearless leader at the front is tasked with
the delicate dance of negotiating oncoming traffic.

Half an hour and a dozen switchbacks later we find ourselves at the trailhead.
As we unload the car we assess the weather to gauge our wardrobe selections.
The sun is poking through mottled clouds, the temperature is hovering right in
the gray area between shortsleeves and long. We're set to climb 2,000 vertical
feet over the course two miles. We will certainly work up a sweat
on the hike but that will be countered by the cooler temperatures on the
mountain. Will the sun stay out? Is it windy up there?

Sufficiently geared up, we hit the trail. The first half mile of the hike takes
us up a mild grade to the top of a bluff overlooking the *Sognefjord*. If this
was the extent of the hike I'd be thrilled. From even this lower station I'm
afforded what is almost certainly the most stunning view I've ever seen in my
life.

While soaking in the surroundings I feel the ominous presence of a dark slab of
metamorphic rock looming over my right shoulder. I turn 'round, crane my neck,
and ponder, we couldn't possibly be going *all the way up there*???

If we were standing on the pavement of 5th Avenue the top of this mountain
would look down on the spire of the Empire State Building. It seems an
insurmountable task; a hopeless fight against the relentless tug of gravity.

But we set off anyway,

No adventure story is complete without a harrowing test of mettle - ours occurs
halfway through the hike when the trail winnows down to a slender footpath
perched atop a cliff hugging the left side of the craggy mass. At this
point all conversation ceases while our expedition navigates the 50 yard
tightrope maneuver, every ounce of concentration devoted to the
precise placement of every step, grabbing hold to the edge of the cliff like
Jimmy Stewart in *Vertigo*.

The final ascent tracks the moderate pitch of the mountain's shoulder. Patches
of small, vibrant flowers line the path, explosions of yellows, reds, and pinks
spackle the mottled green of the dewy moss. Small fields of snow luxuriate in
shady alcoves, stubbornly clinging to their crystalline structure.

The plateaued summit of Mt Prest sinks beneath our hiking boots, waterlogged
from the winter's snowpack.

A cairn stands erect at the R&oslash;yrgrind viewpoint, keeping a stoic,

While gazing out over the 
<a href="/traveler/2023_05-scandinavia/05-oslo_nature.html?id=fjord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glacially eroded sea inlet trough</a>
the weather starts to change. The scattered clouds initiate a descattering
maneuver, enveloping our fjordview behind the veil of a misty fog. Our
lofty kingdom enveloped by a damp grey specter.

Thankfully our chagrin is short lived - as quickly as it came the fog is gone,
sliced into ghostly ribbons of ethereal vapor. Its final memory floating on wispy
tendrils carried away by the dying breaths of the North Atlantic jet stream.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Cruisin'</h4>
The next morning Jill has planned a sightseeing cruise to supplement to our
land-based fjord observations. Unfortunately we're not the only
ones with the idea...

During our mountaineering escapades yesterday we spotted a spec upon the fjord
not much larger than a grain of rice. If it weren't for its slender
emerald tail of churned seawater it likely would have been imperceptible. To our
chagrin that miniscule grain of rice was the *MV Brittania*, the flagship of
P&O Cruises of Southampton, UK.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Go find another fjord!</figcaption>
</figure>

Standing as tall as a 20 story building and as long as three-and-a-half football
fields, the *Brittania*'s 4000 passengers outnumber the permanent residents of
Fl&aring;m 10 to 1.

According to the *Brittania*'s website their *passengers-to-space-ratio* is 33.
It does not specify units. I'm unsure if this is good. Is *PTSR* a selling
point among cruise ships?

As we stroll into town this lovely Norwegian summer morning we're greeted with
an altogether different experience than the charming fjordtown we roamed
yesterday. Gone is the carefree chatter fluttering from charming sidewalk cafes.
In are torpid droves of cruisepeople in gauche Norwegian graphic t-shirts
bloating cafe queues and blocking sidewalks like atherosclerotic plaque.

Swimming against the roiling sea of humanity belched upon the avenues of Fl&aring;m
we finally manage to procure a coffee in a paper cup and a cold pastry. We have
30 minutes till our vessel begins embarking but the line to board has already
begun distending like a flight to Orlando when they announce boarding zone 1.
Unfortunately we decide to join the procession lest we are stuck with an
undesirable vantage. At least we have some stunning views to distract us from
the inane prattle of cruise ship rewards points.

Half an hour later the rope is mercifully dropped and we hop aboard the *Future
of the Fjords*, the first
all-electric carbon fiber vessel in the world. With two 600 horsepower engines
powered by an 1800 kWh battery pack the *Future* can cruise at a breezy 16 knots
for 40 nautical miles on a single charge. To put that into a little perspective,
making some rough assumptions on average car gas tank size and EV battery pack
capacity that's roughly equivalent to 1000 gallons of gasoline.

As we're standing on the deck navigating the roiling sea of humanity belched
upon Fl&aring;m by the *Brittania*

After our cruise we have a few hours to kill before our 6:30 PM reservation on
the Fl&aring;m Railway. Jill found a reasonable hike within walking distance so
we strap on our hikin' boots and set off southbound from town. We stroll along
the Nedre Brekkevegan river bestride bucolic farms
flanked by towering tree-covered cliffs.

A mile south of town we veer right through a cut in the vegetation onto a
well-trod path ascending yet another of Norway's innumerable mountains. The
length of the trail is littered with the heaving breaths of ambitious decisions
made by cruise-ship passengers whose collective fitness level skews towards couch
potato. The unrelenting mid-summer sun intensifies the collective distress;
I pop my tarp.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Trains Are So Cool, Part Deux</h4>
The 12-mile Fl&aring;m Railway has been described as "the most
beautiful train journey in the world". Starting at Fl&aring;m, the railway
winds 2,841 vertical feet up the Halling Valley to the cozy town of Myrdal.

As the electric beast begins its skyward journey we quickly realize that we
picked the wrong side of the train. Not to say this side is bad, it's just all
the best bits are out the windows across the aisle where two surly
septuagenarian women haughtily occupy one third of the inventory of a 6-seat alcove.

The train slithers its way up the gorge, clinging to the jagged
canyon walls like a sure-footed Norwegian coastal goat. The windows slide down.
Do we take advantage? We do

Halfway through the
journey the conductor announces over the intercom that we will be making a
5-minute sightseeing stop at the Kjosfossen waterfall. Our trusty ferric goat
rumbles to a stop at the base of the falls where we spill out of car 7 onto a
wide platform with a striking view of the water feature.

The cascading torrents of Kjosfossen slalom 300 feet down a steep ravine like an
alpine skier navigating a mogul field. The blissful cerulean sky provides the
perfect backdrop to appreciate the wonder of nature.
