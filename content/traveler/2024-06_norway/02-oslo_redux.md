Our Oslo stint began with cocktails - g&ts from Kate and Dustin


<h4 class="article-subheader">Wendelboe</h4>
"Andrew, this is your leg"

"How does everybody feel about coffee?"

"Strongly in favor"

"Ok, there is a world renowned coffee shop just a few blocks away from the
apartment. Let's start there and we can formulate a plan after caffeine."



"Well I was here last year and stopped off for a quick coffee at a place near
Sondre's apartment. Just an in & out to-go type thing before hopping on the
trolley downtown. Turns out the barista was from Australia, so naturally I
ordered a flat white & cut it up with her about bogans."

"Of course you did"

"What can I say? So we eventually circled around to chatting about coffee & how
I was amazed at how good the coffee was in Australia. She was a huge coffee
geek down under & told me she actually moved to Oslo to work for Tim Wendelboe!

"She worked her way up to his head roaster and then right before Covid she
opened up her own shop called Talormade seeing as her name is Talor.
Unfortunately her shop is in the opposite direction because her coffee is
amazing - she roasts it herself and makes fresh gourmet doughnuts to go with
it. Did I mention she's a trained pasty chef?

"But yeah, Talor is who told me to come to Tim Wendelboe last year and I popped
in right before my ferry to Copenhagen. Oh! She also made me this incredible
drink called a cappuccino freddo, have you ever had one?"

"No never heard of it"

"Neither had I. It's apparently from the Greek islands, it's a chilled espresso
drink with a magical creamy foam that makes it feel lighter than air. It didn't
make sense how light the glass was. I still think she might be a witch."

"Anyways, here's Tim Wendelboe's shop. It's the only one since he's obsessed
with his coffee & doesn't want to sacrifice quality by expanding. He won the
award for best barista *in the world* a few years ago so you'd think this
place would have a line out the door. I don't get it."

Thankfully for us the line was not even to the door of the small shop and after
waiting less than 5 minutes a table opened up to accommodate the 6 of us.


I told her how amazed I was at how great the coffee was in Australia
She asked me if I liked coffee
She actually came to Oslo to work for Tim Wendelboe and worked her way up to his

<h4 class="article-subheader">Nature Walk</h4>

From Timmy W's we take a quick stroll to the
<a href="/traveler/2023_05-scandinavia/05-oslo_nature?id=aker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Akerselva</a>,
the main confluence flowing through Oslo from its source at Lake Maridal
4 miles to our north terminating at the fjord a mile to our south.
The stroll to the fjord is a meandering jaunt, nowhere to be

We pass Methallen, one of Oslo's larger food halls, during the mid-morning
doldrums where it's past breakfast time but not yet lunch time. Typically in a
large city you can find rebels who eschew the traditional gustatory time
windows, but Norwegians are nothing if not rule followers. The only activity at
the food hall is by food delivery personnel restocking the restaurants for
the lunch rush.

"Wait, what is this? Is it... like a bike rack for your dog?"

Everybody spins around to see a   shaped like a tiny airplane hangar.
Emblazoned on the side of the structure is *Hundhus*??? with a picture of a
dog. I know *hund* means dog and *hus* means house. But not house in the strict
sense that we use it. We frequently see the words *parkeringhus* associated with
parking garages. A *parking house*, it seems so quaint. So this *hundhus* seems
to be more in line with the more liberal sense of the word, a tiny parking
garage for your dog. I would assume it's only used for owners to run in and
get a coffee but unfortunately for our curiosity there are no hunds parked in
the hus at the moment.

We continue our southerly stroll towards the fjord.







I had only heard about Tim Wendelboe during my Norwegian escapades last year
over a <a href="/traveler/2023_05-scandinavia/07-oslo_gastro?id=talormade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conversation</a>
with Talor Browne, the owner of 
<a href="https://talormade.no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talormade</a>,
specialty coffee and 


<h4 class="article-subheader">Munch</h4>
"I wouldn't exactly describe this crowd as *museum people*"

Shannon hits me with this bombshell just as we're about to enter
<span class="skewed">Munch</span>, i.e. the Edvard Munch museum. Overlooking the
waterfront, <span class="skewed">Munch</span> is Oslo's most controversial
architectural choice but the museum is a must-do in my book.

As we enter I scan the QR code and quickly purchase tickets for all 6 patrons.
There will be no waffling on my watch and if anybody asks me how much it cost
I will lie.

Between the front doors and the entrance to the exhibits I begin to gather
everyone's water bottles, bags, jackets, purses, and any personal belongings
that may be deemed as contraband to stow in a bank of lockers near the entrance. 
Based on my visit last year I know the security guards take their jobs
*very* seriously. Kate eyes the "NO backpacks" sign, looks down at her small
satchel of belongings and declares, "I'll just wear it over my shoulder like a
purse, it'll be fine."

We mosey to the entrance where an unenthusiastic elderly man scans our tickets
and points us towards the security checkpoint. "Please place all bags on the
table for inspection." Kate drops her backpurse onto the table

"There are no backpacks allowed in the museum"

"It's a purse"

"No it's a backpack"

"It's so small it's really just a purse"

"No it's a backpack. It has 2 straps"

"But it's.... a purse"

Defeated, Kate realizes she has no effective counterargument to the *2 strap
defense* and slinks away to deposit her 2-strap bag into the locked receptacles.

As we ride the escalator up to the exhibits I quickly check wikipedia for the
definition of a backpack

<div class="block-quote">
A backpack—also called knapsack, schoolbag, rucksack, pack, booksack, bookbag,
haversack or backsack—is, in its simplest frameless form, a fabric sack carried
on one's back and secured with <b>two straps</b> that go over the shoulders; but
it can have an external or internal frame, and there are bodypacks
[emphasis mine].
</div>

"Kate, it looks like Wikipedia agrees with the security detail. 2 straps a
backpack does make."

"Whose side are you on??"



In contrast with last year's exhibition, this year's offerings focus almost
exclusively on the works of Edvard Munch. Whereas the first two floors of the
museum showcased works from other artists last year, this time 'round it's
wall-to-wall Munch. Which seems like they may be stretching the collection,
seeing as it's only one man, but the museum boasts over *27,000* pieces from
Munch alone.

As we wander the halls I'm taking a continuous temperature check on the group,
assessing their boredom levels as we weave through the 13 floors of the
Munchmuseet. To my delight everyone seems to be enthralled by the activity.
Eyes are wide and excited, faces are beaming,  

The space is more light and vibrant than many cold, stodgy spaces that may have
sparked the group's aversion to museums.

On the 4th floor the group gets their "Ohhhh THAT guy!! moment".
