"Each of our cocktails is sourced with Norwegian ingredients



Our Oslo stint began with cocktails - g&ts from Kate and Dustin


<h4 class="article-subheader">Wendelboe</h4>
"How's everybody feeling? Anybody have any plans for the day?

"Andrew, this is your leg of the trip"

"Alright, so how does everybody feel about coffee?"

"Strongly in favor"

"I was hoping you would say that, follow me"

The gang saddles up and we set off on a short walk to Tim Wendelboe.

"So there is a world renowned coffee shop just a few blocks away, I went here
last year and it was exceptional."

"How did you hear about it?"

"The barista at the coffee shop near Sondre's place recommended it. I had popped
in for a quick coffee - just an in & out to-go type thing on my way downtown -
and it turns out the barista was Australian, so naturally I struck up a
<a href="/traveler/2023_05-scandinavia/07-oslo_gastro?id=talormade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conversation</a> over a flat white."

"Of course you did"

"What can I say? So we eventually circled around to chatting about coffee & how
I was amazed at how good the coffee was in Australia. She was a huge coffee
geek down under & told me she actually moved to Oslo to work for Tim Wendelboe!

"She worked her way up to his head roaster and then right before Covid she
opened up her own shop called <a href="https://talormade.no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talormade</a>
seeing as her name is Talor.
Unfortunately her shop is in the opposite direction because her coffee is
amazing - she roasts it herself and makes fresh gourmet doughnuts to go with
it. Did I mention she's a trained pasty chef?


"But yeah, Talor is who told me to come to Tim Wendelboe last year and I popped
in right before my ferry to Copenhagen. Oh! She also made me this incredible
drink called a cappuccino freddo, have you ever had one?"

"No never heard of it"

"Neither had I. It's apparently from the Greek islands, it's a chilled espresso
drink with a magical creamy foam that makes it feel lighter than air. It didn't
make sense how light the glass was. I still think she might be a witch."

"Anyways, here's Tim Wendelboe's shop. It's the only one since he's obsessed
with his coffee & doesn't want to sacrifice quality by expanding. He won the
award for best barista *in the world* a few years ago so you'd think this
place would have a line out the door. I don't get it."

Thankfully for us the line was not even to the door of the small shop and after
waiting less than 5 minutes a table opened up to accommodate the 6 of us.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Nature Walk</h4>
Functionally caffeinated we step out into the beautiful Norwegian summer
sunshine. Downtown is only a couple miles away so we decide to hoof it
along the
<a href="/traveler/2023_05-scandinavia/05-oslo_nature?id=aker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Akerselva</a>
and soak up the beautiful weather. The entire length of the Akerselva, Oslo's
main confluence flowing through town, was designated as an ecopark in the 1980s
after a century and a half of pollution from the myriad mills and factories that
line the river. Most of the industrial buildings have been converted into bars,
restaurants, apartments, galleries, and various frivolities of modern life.

One such industrial building we pass is called Methallen, one of Oslo's larger
food halls. We trundle by during the mid-morning
doldrums - past breakfast time but not yet lunch time. Typically in a
large city you can find rebels who eschew the traditional gustatory time
windows, but Norwegians are nothing if not rule followers. The only activity at
the food hall is by food delivery personnel restocking the restaurants for
the lunch rush.

"Wait, what is this? Is it... like a bike rack for your dog?"

Everybody spins around to see a metal enclosure shaped like a tiny blimp
hangar. Above the vessel stands a sign with a cartoon picture of a dog and the
word *Hundeparkering*, which translates to "dog parking".

We frequently see the words *parkeringshus* associated with
parking garages. A *parking house*, it seems so quaint. So this *hundhus* seems
to be more in line with the more liberal sense of the word, a tiny parking
garage for your dog. I would assume it's only used for owners to run in and
get a coffee but unfortunately for our curiosity there are no hunds parked in
the hus at the moment.

Our southerly stroll continues past a gaggle of schoolchildren running about
during their recess, go-getters out for a jog, people posted up on blankets in 
the park. All things you do when you have a bipolar relationship with the sun.
Eventually we find ourselves on the outskirts of the city center, where we
cross the *Arkobaten* bridge, i.e. The Acrobat. This asymmetrical steel, glass,
and concrete truss suspension bridge is a beautiful piece of engineering that
nobody else seems to really care about. I mean it won 1st Prize for
Extraordinary Steel & Composite Bridges at the European Award for Steel Bridges
in 2012, you guys, come on!

Just as we reach the other side of the bridge I let out an excited shriek,

***"TALORMADE!!!!!!"***

"Uhhh what??"

"It's Talormade!! The coffee & donut shop I told you about! The one with the
Australian who recommended Tim Wendelboe"

"Ohhhhh ok, we thought you snapped"

"I thought the only location was the one by Sondre's apartment but I must have
read her website wrong. Anybody want another coffee?"

"I could do another coffee"

Everybody orders a donut and a coffee, mine combined with a cappuccino al freddo
so everyone can try this magical espresso elixir.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Munch</h4>
"I wouldn't exactly describe this crowd as *museum people*"

Shannon hits me with this bombshell just as we're about to enter
<span class="skewed">Munch</span>, i.e. the Edvard Munch museum. Overlooking the
waterfront, <span class="skewed">Munch</span> is Oslo's most controversial
architectural choice but the museum is a must-do in my book.

As we enter I scan the QR code and quickly purchase tickets for all 6 patrons.
There will be no waffling on my watch and if anybody asks me how much it cost
I will lie.

Between the front doors and the entrance to the exhibits I begin to gather
everyone's water bottles, bags, jackets, purses, and any personal belongings
that may be deemed as contraband to stow in a bank of lockers near the entrance. 
Based on my visit last year I know the security guards take their jobs
*very* seriously. Kate eyes the "NO backpacks" sign, looks down at her small
satchel of belongings and declares, "I'll just wear it over my shoulder like a
purse, it'll be fine."

We mosey to the entrance where an unenthusiastic elderly man scans our tickets
and points us towards the security checkpoint. "Please place all bags on the
table for inspection." Kate drops her backpurse onto the table

"There are no backpacks allowed in the museum"

"It's a purse"

"No it's a backpack"

"It's so small it's really just a purse"

"No it's a backpack. It has 2 straps"

"But it's.... a purse"

Defeated, Kate realizes she has no effective counterargument to the *2 strap
defense* and slinks away to deposit her 2-strap bag into the locked receptacles.

As we ride the escalator up to the exhibits I quickly check wikipedia for the
definition of a backpack

<div class="block-quote">
A backpack—also called knapsack, schoolbag, rucksack, pack, booksack, bookbag,
haversack or backsack—is, in its simplest frameless form, a fabric sack carried
on one's back and secured with <b>two straps</b> that go over the shoulders; but
it can have an external or internal frame, and there are bodypacks
[emphasis mine].
</div>

"Kate, it looks like Wikipedia agrees with the security detail. 2 straps a
backpack does make."

"Whose side are you on??"



In contrast with last year's exhibition, this year's offerings focus almost
exclusively on the works of Edvard Munch. Whereas the first two floors of the
museum showcased works from other artists last year, this time 'round it's
wall-to-wall Munch. Which seems like they may be stretching the collection,
seeing as it's only one man, but the museum boasts over *27,000* pieces from
Munch alone.

As we wander the halls I'm taking a continuous temperature check on the group,
assessing their boredom levels as we weave through the 13 floors of art. To my
delight everyone seems to be, at the very least, moderately amused.

On the 4th floor moderate amusement turns to "Ohhhh THAT guy!!"

Ranked 4th on a
<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/most-famous-paintings/index.html#4-the-scream">list from CNN </a>
of the most famous paintings in the world, Munch's *The Scream* is instantly
recognizable.

As luck would have it we are privileged to 


The space is more light and vibrant than many cold, stodgy spaces that may have
sparked the group's aversion to museums.
