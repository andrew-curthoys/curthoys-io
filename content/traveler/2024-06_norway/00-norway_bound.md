<h4 class="article-subheader">Are You Following Me?</h4>
I look up from my book and see my good ol friend Zach looking down at me with a
quizzical gaze.

"Are you on this flight to New YorK?"

"Yeah, are you?"

"Yeah... what the hell, I saw you from across the terminal and thought there's
no way I run into you two days in a row"

"I guess it's your lucky day, where are you going in the city?"

"Brooklyn. Bed Stuy. You?"

"Crown Heights"

"Wanna split cab?"

"Hell of a deal"

I ran into Zach yesterday while he was out walking his dog and I was out
running a few miles to justify a beer after this week's run club Wednesday. I
ran into him today on his way to spend some time with friends in NYC before his
cousin's wedding in Boston. He lived in New York for 7 years before succumbing
to the green throated call of the Northern Carolina trees.

"Oh damn, Norway?"

"Yeah, it's a long story, what are you doing in the city?"

"My cousin is getting married in Boston next weekend and I'm going to hang with
some friends in New York before heading up"

"Oh nice, what part of the city?"

"Brooklyn, Bed Stuy"

"Sweet, you want to split a cab into Brooklyn?"

"Sounds good to me"

After splitting up with Zach I head to Michael's to drop my bags, grab a quick
nap, and take the train into Brooklyn Heights. The Brooklyn Promenade is one of
my favorite NYC hangs and today lives up to the billing. 75 and sunny with just
enough people out and about to give a lively "buzzy" feeling but not too many to
feel crowded. I snag a seat on the bench and read a few chapters of my
Vonnegut in between contemplative gazes at the Brooklyn Bridge and
[jealous looks?] of [people?] on jet skis (awesome) on the East River (gross).

I start to feel the 

The day after 
"No what is that?"

"It's this really cool photography showcase down at Brooklyn Bridge Park, they
have photo essays from all over the world set up in shipping containers, it's
super cool"

*Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!*

"I'm assuming this is a pretty big golf tournament?"

"Yeah, the final day of the US Open, there are a couple holes left and that
guy just missed a really big putt... but what's this phototown thing all about?"

"Photoville, it's such a wonderful exhibit, I've gone down there every day
after my shift to walk through it. Some of the subject matter is... heavy...
but it's really spectacular; you should check it out, today is the last day it's
open"

"Amazing, I think I'll do that"

7 hours on an overnight flight with no legroom led

In such a beleaguered state I was in no position to lean on the generosity of
others. And in the hierarchy of "others" I would consider Tom & Monica Bratlie
family.

Big Tom pulls his car up to the library right as the light turns red. I scramble
to toss my baggage into his backseat before the signal reignites its emerald
flame. My largest bag gets hung on a seatbelt and I work on jostling it free as
the light turns green. A line of cars has begun to queue behind us, but in pure
Scandinavian fashion, not a single honked horn. In the grand scheme of things
the 5 seconds I delayed the Oslofolk behind us is mindnumbingly insignificant,
however time operates on a different frequency in a car for some reason.

We enjoy wonderful conversation during the 45 minute drive to S&aelig;tre, with
beautiful views of the Oslofjord.



We got too nervous and made our own travel luck

Ok, I feel much better that you are all sorted out, I'm going to hit the sack,
it's way past my bedtime.
