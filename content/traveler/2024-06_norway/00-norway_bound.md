<h4 class="article-subheader">Are You Following Me?</h4>
I glance up from my book to see my good friend Zach looking down at me with a
quizzical gaze.

"Are you on this flight to New YorK?"

"Yeah, you?"

"Yeah... what the hell, I saw you from across the terminal and thought there's
no way I run into you two days in a row"

I crossed Zach's path yesterday while he was on a dog walk and I was on a bike
ride. I ran into him today en route to a week in NYC with friends before his
cousin's wedding in Boston. He lived in New York for 7 years before succumbing
to the sylvan call of the Northern Carolina timberland.

"I guess it's your lucky day, where are you headed?"

"Brooklyn. Bed Stuy. You?"

"Crown Heights"

"Oh nice! That's pretty close to where I'm going, wanna split a cab?"

"Hell of a deal"

A few hours later said cab drops us at Herbert Von King Park in the heart of
Bed Stuy with grumbling bellies.

"There's an awesome ramen place near here but it doesn't open till noon, wanna
grab a drink while we wait?"

"Great idea"

I follow Zach towing an assemblage of luggage to outfit two days of working in
Manhattan, a
week of hiking in Norway, a wedding in St. Louis, and general city rompabout wear.
We find a spot on the patio at **CAPT. DAN'S**
<span class="text-danger">*"Good Time"*</span> **TAVERN**, an eclectic
neighborhood watering hole with goofy shit on the walls and quirkily appellated
cocktails such as *The Cinematic Powerhouse that is Bollywood*, *A Tomato Few
Around My Room*, and, of course, *Blue Motorcycle*, a blue-tinted long island
iced tea served on draft.

Anyone who knows me will find it as no surprise that I order the *Passionfruit
of the Christ*, a concoction of green tea gin, passionfruit-orange-guava syrup,
pistachio orgeat, Chinola passionfruit liquer, and Neversink reserve gin - an
apple-based gin sourced from a single orchard in New York State.

As I sip my tastefully tart, seductively sweet summer libation Zach takes a
stroll down memory lane. As a born & bred Masshole he was nonplussed with the
prospect of moving to the big brother metropolis to the south. He spent his
entire NYC tenure in Queens, stubbornly resisting entreaties from his friends
to move to Brooklyn.


As the contents of my glass dwindle away under the splendor of a Brooklyn sun I
spot an old friend on the beer menu.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Have You Heard Of Photoville?</h4>
After splitting up with Zach I head to Michael's to drop my bags, grab a quick
nap, and take the train into Brooklyn Heights. The Brooklyn Promenade is one of
my favorite NYC hangs and today lives up to the billing. 75 and sunny with just
enough people out and about to give a lively "buzzy" feeling but not too many to
feel crowded. I snag a seat on the bench and read a few chapters of my
Vonnegut in between contemplative gazes at the Brooklyn Bridge and
covetous leerings of mariners piloting jet skis (awesome) on the East River
(gross).

20 minutes of direct solar radiation proves to be my limit, at which point I
wander 'round 'neath the shade trees. After a quick peek at the US Open
leaderboard I duck into 

The day after 
"No what is that?"

"It's this really cool photography showcase down at Brooklyn Bridge Park, they
have photo essays from all over the world set up in shipping containers, it's
super cool"

*Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!*

"I'm assuming this is a pretty big golf tournament?"

"Yeah, the final day of the US Open, there are a couple holes left and that
guy just missed a really big putt... but what's this phototown thing all about?"

"Photoville, it's such a wonderful exhibit, I've gone down there every day
after my shift to walk through it. Some of the subject matter is... heavy...
but it's really spectacular; you should check it out, today is the last day it's
open"

"Amazing, I think I'll do that"

<h4 class="article-subheader">How Close Are You To The Sea?</h4>
7 hours on an overnight flight with no legroom led

In such a beleaguered state I was in no position to deny the generosity of
others. And in the hierarchy of "others" I would consider Tom & Monica Bratlie
family.

Big Tom pulls his car up to the library right as the light turns red. I scramble
to toss my baggage into his backseat before the signal reignites its emerald
flame. My largest bag gets hung on a seatbelt and I work on jostling it free as
the light turns green. A line of cars has begun to queue behind us, but in pure
Scandinavian fashion, not a single honked horn. In the grand scheme of things
the 5 seconds I delayed the Oslofolk behind us is mindnumbingly insignificant,
however time operates on a different frequency in a car for some reason.

We enjoy wonderful conversation during the 45 minute drive to S&aelig;tre, with
beautiful views of the Oslofjord.

"Oh! Did Sondre tell you the good news?"

"I-I don't think so?"

"He proposed to Nora two days ago!"

"What!! No way!! He didn't say a thing!!"

"She said yes"

"Well I hope you wouldn't tell me if she said no! I did have a suspicion she'd
say yes - last year she asked me when the hell Sondre was going to propose!"

"Monica and I are very excited"

"As you should be!"


"Do you mind if I stop at the store for groceries for dinner?"

"Of course not!"

Big Tom pulls off into a _______ (grocery store) where he navigates his cart
with the deftness of Ayrton Senna ___spelling___ at Monaco 1986???
As I must imagine most grocery runs in Norway begin, ours begins at the fish
counter. Big Tom has the personality that I can't tell if he has known this
pescine professional for years or has just met him. While they presumably
discuss fish stuff I walk the length of his case, admiring the fishes he has
mongered.

In the middle of conversing about our goings since my last annual (hopefully)
visit to Norway Big Tom casually whips together a truffle roasted Halibut, seared
broccolini, braised mushrooms, blistered tomatoes, and mashed potatoes.
all paired with a sauvignon blanc. 

Gratitude

We ferry our supper to the rooftop deck, overlooking the southern reaches of the
*Oslofjord*.

"How close are you to the sea?" Big Tom asks me in a tone that suggests
proximity to the sea is a essential to the human condition as oxygen.

"Pretty close actually, it's only about 3 hours"

"Oh.. ok" remarks Big Tom, hiding a pained expression.

I was excited to tell Big Tom how close I lived to the sea. One of my favorite
__benefits__ of living in the Triangle of North Carolina is our proximity to the
sea. 3 hours to the mountains and 3 hours to the sea. What could be better?

Big Tom lives 2 hours from the mountains and could kick a soccer ball into the sea.

That's better.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Euros</h4>
Unfortunately my time spent with Sondre is limited. My trip coincides with the
UEFA European  Championship soccer tournament.

Shooting pool with Brage's friends texting with Shannon


"We got too nervous and made our own travel luck"

"Ok, I feel much better that you are all sorted out, I'm going to hit the sack,
it's way past my bedtime."
