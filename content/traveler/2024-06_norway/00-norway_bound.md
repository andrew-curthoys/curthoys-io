<h4 class="article-subheader">Are You Following Me?</h4>
I look up from my book and see my good ol friend Zach looking down at me with a
quizzical gaze.

"What the hell are you doing here? I saw you from across the terminal and
thought no way in hell I run into him two days in a row"

Yesterday I bumped into Zach as he was walking his dog through the neighborhood
on my homestretch of run club.

"Are you on this flight to NYC?"

"Yeah, I'm heading up to the city to spend a few days with my cousin before
flying out to Norway"

"Oh damn, Norway?"

"Yeah, it's a long story, what are you doing in the city?"

"My cousin is getting married in Boston next weekend and I'm going to hang with
some friends in New York before heading up"

"Oh nice, what part of the city?"

"Brooklyn, Bed Stuy"

"Sweet, you want to split a cab into Brooklyn?"

"Sounds good to me"

<h4 class="article-subheader">Have You Heard Of Photoville?</h4>
"No what is that?"

"It's this really cool photography showcase down at Brooklyn Bridge Park, they
have photo essays from all over the world set up in shipping containers, it's
super cool"

*Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!*

"I'm assuming this is a pretty big golf tournament?"

"Yeah, the final day of the US Open, there are a couple holes left and that
guy just missed a really big putt... but what's this phototown thing all about?"

"Photoville, it's such a wonderful exhibit, I've gone down there every day
after my shift to walk through it. Some of the subject matter is... heavy...
but it's really spectacular; you should check it out, today is the last day it's
open"

"Amazing, I think I'll do that"

My new friend Gabby, on the business side of the bar, bonded over music

7 hours on an overnight flight with no legroom led

In such a beleaguered state I was in no position to lean on the generosity of
others. And in the hierarchy of "others" I would consider Tom & Monica Bratlie
family.

Big Tom pulls his car up to the library right as the light turns red. I scramble
to toss my baggage into his backseat before the signal reignites its emerald
flame. My largest bag gets hung on a seatbelt and I work on jostling it free as
the light turns green. A line of cars has begun to queue behind us, but in pure
Scandinavian fashion, not a single honked horn. In the grand scheme of things
the 5 seconds I delayed the Oslofolk behind us is mindnumbingly insignificant,
however time operates on a different frequency in a car for some reason.

We enjoy wonderful conversation during the 45 minute drive to S&aelig;tre, with
beautiful views of the Oslofjord.



We got too nervous and made our own travel luck

Ok, I feel much better that you are all sorted out, I'm going to hit the sack,
it's way past my bedtime.
