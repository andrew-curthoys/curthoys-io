<h4 class="article-subheader">"I Just Saw 2 Penises"</h4>

Wait....

What??

Trembling, Jill falls into her chair at Zachariasbryggen Brewery in the heart of
downtown Bergen, reeling from a bewildering encounter,

<div class="block-quote">
  <p>
		"Ok... so Michael said the bathrooms were out and to the right so I went out and
		to the right...
	</p>
  <p>
		and there was no bathroom...
	</p>
		so I went down one floor and <b>then</b> to the right...
  </p>
	<p>
		and there was no bathroom...
  </p>
	<p>
		Then I saw signs for toilets but there were no toilets! It was so confusing! So I
		turned the corner and pushed open the first door that looked like a bathroom -
		with no gender markings whatsoever - and saw two old guys with their penises
		flopped right out there in the open!"
  </p>
	<p>
		"Like, what the fuck? How did that happen... And do guys just pee with their
		dicks out like that?... Why did you tell me to go that way, Michael?"
  </p>
</div>

<div class="block-quote mb-3" style="color:firebrick!important;">
	"I've never been here, why would you trust me?"
</div>

<div class="block-quote mb-3">

<h4 class="article-subheader">We Just Landed!!!"</h4>
8 hours prior to Jill's downstairs mixup the 4.5 ft diameter wheels of
Norse Atlantic Airways flight NBT2's Boeing 787 Dreamliner touch down at
Oslo Gardermoen Airport. Shortly thereafter I establish communication with the
travelers,

While the crew deplanes I put the finishing touches on the day's crossword aided
by the last remnants of my coffee. A coffee, which I take no pleasure in
reporting, is considerably superior to nearly all coffee you
get in the states. Thanks Charbucks.

Anyways, just as I'm about to traverse across the terminal to greet our
Transatlantic Travelers I receive another text from Shannon,

Unfortunately SAS Airlines was unmoved by my entreaties to wait for my compadres.
But the process to rebook was startlingly smooth; my arrival at the counter
suggested it would be anything but. Ascending the escalator to the departures
gallery I'm confronted with the typical roiling swarm of humanity that
agglomerates at transportation chokepoints in our global economy. Lines
snaking, nerves fraying, masses huddling. I wove my way through crowds whose
faces have been locked in a state of anguish so thoroughly complete that
they've acquired an air of acceptance. *I live at this airport now* energy is a
real buzzkill.

So my disposition is already bleak as I perambulate upon a SAS customer
service booth thronged with a horde of frazzled travelers. As I hesitantly
approach the scrum my advanced height affords a favorable vantage from which
to observe the locus of the collective's attention: a stylized aluminum
monolith brandished with the italic uppercase blue
<span style="color:#2B3087; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold;">SAS</span>
logo displaying a Microsoft Surface tablet in the middle stages of a hard reset.

Beside the apparatus stood a SAS customer service representative in a smart,
light blue skirt suit with a tight ponytail and strained smile that suggests,
*don't let this smile distract from the fact that all of you are morons*

<div class="block-quote">
Our technicians have fixed the problem and the system will be rebooted shortly,
we will be with you in just a moment
</div>

Just then a Microsoft Windows logo appears amidst a blue digital background.
A few seconds later the logo dissolves to reveal a customer service help screen,
a lone button labeled "Customer Service" floating atop a sea of light grey that
can only be described as *Windows 95-esque*. Once it's been determined I've
waited the requisite amount of time based on my arrival time to the queuemob I
press the button and a slip of paper gurgitates from the mouth of the contraption.

**B103**

I pause for a moment to revel in the absurdity of this moment. Scandinavian
Airlines is employing a device to serve as a glorified roll of perforated paper
at a deli counter with more computing power than existed on Earth when we put a
man on the moon. The society of automated machines whirring about in
Kurt Vonnegut's 1952 novel *Player Piano* in the front sleeve of my backpack
feels painfully on-the-nose at this moment. 

I press the button, pull a slip and wait about 5 minutes, watching the TV
display above the service desk smoothly
increment through the upper nineties until it reads **B103**.

"Hi, I'm on the 3 PM flight to Bergen with 3 friends but they are still stuck
in the customs line. We're not going to be able to make our flight, would it be
possible to rebook to a later flight?"

I show our reservation details to the representative.

"Ok, there are 4 of you?"

"Yes"

"Ok, you are rebooked on the 4:15 PM flight, is there anything else I can help
you with?"

"No... uhhhh... that's it?"

"Yes. Is there anything else I can help you with?"

"Uhhhh no..... that was... really helpful, thank you so much... tusen takk"

"V&aelig;r s&aring; god"

20 minutes later my compatriots are finally released from their temporary
imprisonment with 2 hours time served under their belt. We share a round of hugs
and I commiserate with Jill about the monsters that are Shannon & Michael,
notorious plane sleepers who conked out the second the wheels left the tarmac.
Jill suffered through the same planesomnia as I, but seems to be in
much better spirits than I was when I arrived.

"Where's the SAS check in?"

"Section 3 - I've had plenty of time to wander around the airport while y'all
were in the customs line. I'm pretty much an expert on the Oslo Gardermoen
domestic departures terminal"

"Ok expert, we have a plane to catch"

"Right this way"

The security checkpoint for domestic flights is guarded by an automated glass
gate that swings open when presented with a boarding pass. We present our
credentials to the robotic bouncer, plop our bags on the conveyor, and breeze
through the metal detector. Not once were we required to show ID during the
whole process. Very trusting people, the Scandinavians.

As we're restuffing our belongings into our knapsacks Jill peeks at the
big board for our gate number.

"Oh, looks like our original flight was canceled"

Now, I have no reason to question Jill's reading comprehension or airport
acumen but I instinctively divert my attention from my entropy reducing
activities and wheel around to the same screen that Jill is peering at.

**Bergen SAS SK271 15:00 CANCELLED**

Satisfied with my own assessment of the situation I pirouette back to Jill,

"Oh wow, yeah it is canceled"

As if she was waiting with bated breath for my affirmation.

There's no way to know for sure but I'm going to believe that the passport
control fiasco benefited us. Instead of scrambling for the scraps on the next
flight when it was canceled we all got seats in the same row and were able to
mosey along to our gate.

That's the thing about travel mercies. They are mysterious.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Bergen</h4>

Three hours later our peregrinating posse is rambling through the streets of
Bergen, Norway in a rented ruby red Toyota Corolla crossover, unsure of what any
of the street signs mean,

"Are we going the wrong way? What do these signs with a red X going through them
mean? I feel like this is wrong but the GPS says to go this way... I think?"

After a few questionable but ostensibly legal side alleys in the heart of
old Bergen we find ourselves us at our accommodation at last.
We drop our bags and trundle down to the city center. We walk past
*Bryggen* (Norwegian for "the dock"), a series of shops, museums, restaurants,
and pubs lining the east side of V&aring;gen harbor dating back to the 11th
century.

<figure class="figure container">
		<img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/traveler/2024-06_norway/01-bergen_bryggen.jpeg" alt="Bryggen">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Like something out of a fairytale</figcaption>
</figure>

All this traveling has worked up an appetite so we duck into Bryggeriet Gastropub
at the southernmost terminus of the harbor. The host leads us to a capacious
live-edge wooden table situated against a long leather booth festooned with
pelts from unidentified mammals on each seat.  At the far end of the table
floor-to-ceiling windows facilitate panoramic views of the harbor and the 9
o'clock sun hanging high in the sky.

We begin, naturally, with a round of &oslash;l. Shannon opts for the Kjaugutt Amber
Ale from 7 Fjell Bryggeri of Bergen, our only local selection. The rest of us
choose offerings from N&oslash;gne &Oslash;, a brewery in the small seaside town
of Grimstad. Jill settles on the Rygene Lager, described in the menu by what I'm
assuming is the effluence spilling forth from a hastily presented google
translate query as a *"Fantastic, refreshing lager made with a dedication for us"*.

Finally, the fellas, feelin' rascally, order a couple of 11.5% ABV ham sammiches.
Michael, the Three Sheets strong ale, and yours truly opting for the Wegelage
spontaneous ale brewed with "Norwegian floor malted barley, wheat, oats, and
sweet cherries from Frederiksdal."


And this is where Jill is introduced
to the *urinal trough*, the most efficient expulsion of effluent in civilized
society.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Trains Are So Cool</h4>
I have been on a few trips with Jill. Jill is a fabulous trip companion. Jill
makes spreadsheets of trip plans and activities. We love Jill.

On my first night in Norway I told Big Tom about Jill's predilection for
planning over supper on the rooftop,

"I'm meeting Shannon, Jill, and Michael at the airport on Saturday then flying
directly to Bergen. We're going to stay that night in Bergen then rent a car to drive
out to the fjords - I think we're staying a couple nights in
a place called Fl&aring;m?"

"Oh yes, I know Fl&aring;m - it's wonderful, you're going to love it there."

"Amazing! I didn't plan any of this so I'm just along for the ride."

"If you have time in Bergen you should take the railway, how do you say it in
English? It goes up the mountain with the cable"

"Funicular?"

"Yes! The funicular! You should take the funicular, you get great views of
the city up on the mountain."

"Oh! I'll add that to the spreadsheet!"

"The spreadsheet?"

"Yeah, our friend Jill made a spreadsheet for the trip with all the plans and
ideas. I'm definitely adding that! I love funiculars!"

*I love funiculars*. What a weirdo.

Anyways, back in Bergen, we settle up at the Gastropub and walk out into the
vibrant nighttime sunlight. It's quarter to ten. Around when you might expect
evening drowsiness to ensue. But we feel not the least bit somnolent.
It's simply too bright for sleep.

"What time does that railroad close? What is it? Fernilinder? Funrickider?
Fundickaler?"

"Funicular" 

"Fundickular!"

"Close enough"

"Google says it's open till midnight, what do y'all think?"

"Let's do it!"

The Fl&oslash;ibanen, a 2,760 ft funicular railway in the center of Bergen,
shepherds over a million passengers a year one thousand feet into the sky.
The trains run every half hour and as luck would have it the next car leaves
in 3 minutes. Typically this may cause a small degree of anxiety, what with the
need to purchase tickets and all, but we're in
Scandinavia where the efficiency of transactions knows no rival.

Three taps on a touchscreen kiosk and one tap of my credit card and we're
through. Between clicks 2 and 3 I make a quick decision to unilaterally purchase
all vouchers for the group - a choice not made out of magnanimity, but out of
pure selfishness. The price
of a ticket, while not expensive, falls in the grey area of "this seems
cool I guess but I don't know if I want to pay that much." As a funicular-head
in a group of non-fheads I decide to incur the cost of the collective lest they
demur against the inclined railway adventure.

Funiculars are so fun because they typically terminate at an elevated vista with
wonderful views but most importantly employ some crafty design and engineering.
What's not to love! Funicular railways are characterized by a pair of railway
carriages attached to a cable for locomotion. If not for the cable the
contact of the steel wheels on the steel track wouldn't generate
enough friction to overcome the pull of gravity.

With funiculars the pull of gravity is cleverly used to their advantage - two
train cars are attached to each end of a rope that counterbalance each other on
their trips up & down the incline. The only
power the motor needs to provide is the difference in weight of the two cars
(typically the combined weight of the passengers) and various frictional losses
in the system.

</figure>

Atop the train we venture out onto a multi-level promenade overlooking the city.
Approaching the precipice of the panoramic vista renders the group speechless.
An entire city going about their business down there. Don't they know how
beautiful it is up here? I convince myself that Norwegians are the hardest
working people on earth. There's no way I could ever bring myself to work in
this environment. It's so stunning I'd just waste away, asking passersby *can
you believe this view??*

In our meanderings we happen upon a small building with a sign posted on the
side that says "Say hi to the goats" and photos of 10 goats named Pippi,
Waldemar, Fl&oslash;ydis, Alex, Fr&oslash;ya, Ferdinand, Stjerna, Gucci, Trym,
and, of course, Spot.

We're not 10 steps away from the sign when we spot our first gaggle of goats
munching on grass just off the pedestrian footpath.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Waldemar, Alex, & Gucci</figcaption>
</figure>

And then even on the footpath.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Fjord Fordin'</h4>
We take our time rousing ourselves after our late night enjoying the midnight
sun. Haphazardly packed, we spill onto the streets of Bergen just before
checkout time. After a bit of moseying we make our way to G&oslash;dt
Br&oslash;d for some breakfast and coffee. Seeing as it's nearly noon our
breakfast consists of deli sandwiches hand crafted to order by perhaps the
nicest Gen Z'er to ever slap mayonnaise on focaccia.

"Here are your coffees, come back when you finish for a free refill!" Helga
(I'm just assuming her name is Helga) cheerily tells us. After Shannon and I
slurp down our coffees (Jill and Michael ordered Americanos and thusly were not
afforded the free refill perk) I ferry our mugs to the counter for our allotted
refills. Upon completion of the second cup Shannon and I get a devious twinkle
in our eyes.

"We should go get another refill right?"

While Shannon is waiting in line for our illicit java a middle-aged woman in a
plaid rain jacket mistakes Shannon's hap modesty for a hapless
American and flags down the barista. "Can you give this American a refill when
you finish ringing me up" she presumably says in Norwegian and turns to Shannon
with a tight smile Shannon bordering on condescension,

"She will help you with the refill in just a moment"

{{ m.divider() }}

Sated and caffeinated, we splash back to the car in the rain. From all accounts
this seems to be the default weather pattern in Bergen, a sitting duck in
the middle of a deluge of warm, moist air from the gulf stream. The rain
continues for the first two hours of the three hour drive to Fl&aring;m,
blanketing our view of the fjords.

As we approach the eastern flank of the *Sognefjord* the rain slowly begins to
lift and we catch our first glimpses of the majesty of the fjords.

Despite our fixed port-side gazes, Jill and I can almost assuredly predict an
approaching tunnel - if Shannon lifts her phone to the window to record a video
we're inevitably seconds away from a subterranean expedition. No doubt it's
Ska&eth;i chiding Shannon for attempting to
document her majestic kingdom with a pithy phone video.

Sitting dutifully in the driver's seat, Michael is the only occupant looking
straight ahead. As he navigates our crimson steed into our final descent
we emerge from yet another tunnel into a steep-walled valley that snaps
our gaze frontward.

"Hoooooly shit," I exclaim with the sophistication of a distinguished scholar.

"This must be *The Valley of the Waterfalls*," Jill confidently declares, the
only one of us who has done any advanced scouting. With a title perfectly
fit for a dust jacket on Reese Witherspoon's book list,
*The Valley of the Waterfalls* paints the picture of the edenic landscape
stretched before us. On this drive we've seen valleys and we've seen waterfalls
but this is the Platonic ideal of their geologic union.

Before us stretches a wide, verdant plain rolled out like an emerald carpet in
the hallway of the gods. On either side towering palisades of anorthositic granite
scrape the sky with their serrated edges. Torrents of water, too many to count,
throw themselves from the cliffs as if to momentarily experience the feeling of
flight. The spray seems to soar towards the earth in slow motion before
crashing on the escarpment below.

The wide valley is bisected by the N&aelig;r&oslash;ydalselvi River, collecting
the      of the waterfalls before escorting it to the N&aelig;r&oslash;yfjord.
(fun fact - the N&aelig;r&oslash;yfjord was the inspiration for Arendelle in
*Frozen*)

At the terminus of the valley we reach the *Gudvangatunnelen*, the penultimate
tunnel before reaching Fl&aring;m. Boring 7 miles through a snarl of precambrian
charnockitic gneiss, the *Gudvangatunnelen* is Norway's third longest road
tunnel (the first longest - the *L&aelig;rdalstunnelen* sits just on the other
side of Fl&aring;m. It also carries the distinction of being the *world's*
longest road tunnel).

Halfway through our subterranean journey the tubular
cavern alights with colorful LEDs, washing the inside of the tunnel in a
rotating series of bright pinks,
purples, blues, and reds. It feels like a dance party might break out at any
moment. As Jill later discovers, the lights were installed to break up the
monotony of the miles upon miles of gray tunnel walls.

In the process of researching the names & details of this story I stumbled upon
an attraction in Google Maps simply titled "Waterfall with bridge." It appears
to be a relatively mundane (by Norwegian standards) waterfall equipped with a
wooded footbridge over its outfall. With a 4.7 / 5 average rating from 7
the reviews are tepid,

<div class="block-quote mb-4">
	Not a clear path towards this bridge, but a very beautiful place.
	<span style="color:gold;font-weight:bold;">&starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;&star;</span>
</div>

<div class="block-quote mb-4">
	Short hike with your dog.	
	<span style="color:gold;font-weight:bold;">&starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;&star;</span>
</div>

Then Arne Bergsvik, a certified local guide, enters the mix, putting these
underwhelmed brats in their place,

<div class="block-quote mb-4">
	Nature will give you wonderful moments.  You just need to open your eyes or keep your ears open as well. Do not expect always wowww moments. Just enjoy.
	<span style="color:gold;font-weight:bold;">&starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;&star;</span>
</div>

If that's all there was I wouldn't have given it any more thought. I certainly
wouldn't be wasting my time writing about it.
But what caught my attention were a series of "reviews" by a user named Andrea
Vianca Gaurano who inexplicably uploaded videos of her playing
a video game in which a goat roams around a school called Goatville High
(go Razorbucks) gathering points by jumping on top of things.
