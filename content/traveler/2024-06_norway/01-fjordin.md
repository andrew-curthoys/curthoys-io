<h4 class="article-subheader">"I Just Saw 2 Penises"</h4>
Jill comes back to the table at Bryggeriet Gastropub in the heart of Bergen
looking like she's seen a ghost,

"Ok... so Michael said to go out and to the right... I went out and to the right
and there was no bathroom... so I went down one floor and *then* to the right and
the signs were so confusing... It said toilets but there were no toilets, I
tried the two doors there and they were both locked, I walked around the
corner and saw a sign for toilets and when I opened it I saw two old guys with
their penises flopped right out in the open. Why did you tell me to go that way,
Michael?"

"Why would you trust me? I've never been here"

"MICHAEL!!!"


<h4 class="article-subheader">We Just Landed!!!"</h4>
8 hours before Jill's unfortunate water closet mixup the 4 1/2 foot tall
wheels of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner carrying the passengers of Norse Atlantic
flight N02 touched down at Oslo Gardermoen Airport.

[text about landing and going through passport control]



"Ok they rebooked us on the 4:15"

The process for rebooking was startlingly smooth despite the throng of
frazzled travelers huddled around the SAS customer service booth as I approach.
My advanced heigh offers me a vantage point to see a smiling SAS customer
service representative standing next to a computerized tablet perched atop a
stylized metal monolith.

"Our technicians have fixed the problem and the system will be rebooted shortly,
we will be with you in just a moment"

Just then a Microsoft Windows logo appears amidst an azure blue background on
the tablet.

The society of automated machines whirring about in Kurt Vonnegut's *Player
Piano* in the front sleeve of my backpack feels very on the nose at this
moment. 

I press the "Customer Service" button and a slip of paper gurgitates from the
mouth of the contraption.

**B103**

Scandinavian Airlines is employing a device with more computing power than
existed on earth when we put a man on the moon to serve the same function as a
roll of perforated paper at a deli counter.

I wait about 5 minutes, watching the LED ticker above the booths smoothly
increment their tally through the upper nineties until it reads **B103**.

"Hi, I'm on the 3 PM flight to Bergen with 3 friends but they are still stuck
in the customs line. We're not going to be able to make our flight, would it be
possible to rebook to a later flight?"

I hand my phone with our 3 PM reservation details to the representative.

"Ok, there are 4 of you?"

"Yes"

"Ok, you are rebooked on the 4:15 PM flight, is there anything else I can help
you with?"

"No... that was... really helpful, thank you so much... tusen takk"

"V&aelig;r s&aring; god"


<h4 class="article-subheader">Bergen</h4>
I'm restuffing my belongings into my knapsack post-security at Oslo Gardermoen
Airport when Jill looks at the big board for our gate to Bergen.

"Oh, looks like our original flight was canceled"

I divert my attention from my entropy reducing activities and spin around to
face the departures display.

Now, I have no reason to question Jill's reading comprehension or airport
experience but there's something about human nature that subconsciously pulls
my attention away from my entropy reducing activities to wheel around and stare
at the same screen that Jill is peering at.

**Bergen SAS SK271 15:00 CANCELLED**

Satisfied with my own assessment of the situation I pirouette back to Jill, as
if she was waiting with bated breath for my affirmation,

"Oh wow, yeah it is canceled"

There's no way to know but I'm going to believe that their passport control
fiasco benefited us. We got seats all in the same row before anybody else had to
scramble for 

That's the thing about travel mercies. They are mysterious.

Three hours later we are rambling through the streets of Bergen, Norway in a
rented Toyota Corolla crossover, unsure of what any of the street signs mean,

"Am I going the wrong way? What do these signs with a red X going through them
mean? I feel like this is wrong but the GPS says to go this way. I think?"

After a sinuous path through the streets of old Bergen we arrive at our airbnb.




And that's how Jill was introduced to the urinal trough at 
an incredible purveyor of food and beer and an even better purveyor of
efficient effluent expulsion.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Trains Are So Cool</h4>
I have been on a couple trips with Jill. Jill is a fabulous trip companion. Jill
makes spreadsheets of trip plans and activities. We love Jill.

Over rooftop dinner with Big Tom on my first night in Norway I tell him our
plans,

"I'm meeting Shannon, Jill, and Michael at OSL on Saturday


During my first night in Norway, Big Tom 

* Cornelius restaurant
* Funicular train
* Edvard Grieg museum

"Oh! I should add that to the spreadsheet!"


<h4 class="article-subheader">Fjord Fordin'</h4>
Our plan for the day following our stay in Bergen involves a hike. That's about
the extent of my knowledge of the plans, I'm just along for the ride. Thankfully
I brought hiking boots for just this occasion.

We mosey about after our late night enjoying the midnight sun and trundle onto
the streets of Bergen just before checkout time. We make our way to G&oslash;dt
Br&oslash;d for some breakfast and coffee. Seeing as it's nearly noon our
breakfast consists of deli sandwiches hand crafted to order by perhaps the
nicest Gen Z'er to ever slap mayonnaise on focaccia.

"Here are your coffees, come back when you finish for a free refill!" Helga
(I'm just assuming her name is Helga) cheerily tells us. After Shannon and I
slurp down our coffees (Jill and Michael ordered Americanos and thusly were not
afforded the free refill perk) I ferry our mugs to the counter for our allotted
refills. Upon completion of the second cup Shannon and I get a devious twinkle
in our eyes.

"We should go get another refill right?"

As Shannon is standing at the counter waiting to receive our illicit java a
woman in front of her in line mistakes Shannon's modicum of hap for a hapless
American and flags down the barista. "Can you give this American a refill when
you finish ringing me up" she presumably says in Norwegian, turns and smiles at
Shannon.

"She will help you with the refill in just a moment"

Once satisfied with brekky we walk back to the car in the rain. From all accounts
this seems to be the default weather pattern in Bergen, sitting directly in the
path of moist air from the gulf stream. The rain holds for the first two hours
of the three hour drive to Fl&aring;m, blanketing our view of the fjords
between the myriad tunnels (we drove through _____ tunnels along the way)

As we approach the eastern flank of the *Sognefjord* the rain slowly begins to
lift and we catch our first glimpses of the majesty of the fjords.

Steep walled canyons flanking placid emerald wa-

Sitting dutifully in the driver's seat, Michael is the only occupant of our
coach looking straight ahead. Despite our fixed port-side gazes, Shannon, Jill,
and I can almost assuredly predict when a tunnel is approaching - once Shannon
starts to take a video a tunnel is surely soon to follow.

As we begin the final descent to our destination our red Toyota Corolla cross
emerges from a tunnel to a valley that draws our gaze frontward.

"This must be the Valley of the Waterfalls I read about," Jill declares, the
only one of us who has done advanced scouting of the area.

On either side of the wide valley sprawled before us torrents of water cascade
from their heavenly perch. 


The final tunnel before Fl&aring;m streches ______ miles, the third longest
road tunnel in Norway. Halfway through the tunnel alights with colorful LED
lights, washing the inside of the tunnel in a rotating series of bright pinks,
purples, blues, and reds. It feels like a dance party might break out at any
moment. As Jill later discovers, the lights were installed to ______________
drivers, who had the tendency to daydream under the monotonous tube of the
tunnel.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Mountain Climbers</h4>
The trailhead for our hike sits above the town of Aurland, a stone's throw up
the road from Fl&aring;m. As we mosey through town Jill recalls that Aurland has
a bakery famous for its cinnamon rolls. We stop just on the other side of the
bridge for some carbs to gear up for the hike.

The drive to the trailhead is up a one-lane switchback road overlooking Aurland.
And when I say one-lane I mean *ONE* lane. Uphill and downhill traffic must
manage the single lane in a game of mountainside chicken. We have found ourselves
in the middle of a caravan of RVs and motorcycles, a desirable spot where we
can simply *go with the flow*. Our fearless leader at the front is tasked with
the delicate dance of negotiating oncoming traffic.

Half an hour and a dozen switchbacks later we find ourselves at the trailhead.
As we unload the car we assess the weather to gauge our wardrobe selections.
The sun is poking through mottled clouds, the temperature is hovering right in
the gray area between shortsleeves and long. We're set to climb 2,000 vertical
feet over the course of a mile and three-quarters. We will certainly work up a sweat
on the hike but that will be countered by the cooler temperatures on the
mountain. Will the sun stay out? Is it windy up there?

Sufficiently geared up, we hit the trail. The first half mile of the hike takes
us up a mild grade to the top of a bluff overlooking the *Sognefjord*. If this
was the extent of the hike I'd be thrilled. Even from this lower station affords
some of the most stunning views I've ever seen in my life.


We couldn't possibly be going *all the way up there*. It looks an insurmountable
task. 1,500 more feet to fight gravity. 100 calories of potential energy.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Trains Are So Cool, Part Deux</h4>
The Fl&aring;m Railway has been described as "the most beautiful train journey
in the world". Starting at Fl&aring;m, a town of 400 residents at the
southeastern tip of the *Sognefjord*, the railway winds 866 meters (____ ft)
up the ___________ valley to ______________.

It's soon made clear that we picked the wrong side of the train. Not to say this
side is bad, it's just all the best bits are out the windows transverse(?) to
our position. In that station sit two surly septuagenarian women occupying one
third of the inventory of a 6-seat alcove.

Trains are so cool because you can talk about the steepness of a hill like "18
in 1" and say things like "rolling stock".
