<h4 class="article-subheader">"I Just Saw 2 Penises"</h4>
Jill returns to our table at Bryggeriet Gastropub in the heart of Bergen
looking like she's seen a ghost,

"Ok... so Michael said to go out and to the right... I went out and to the right
and there was no bathroom... so I went down one floor and *then* to the right and
the signs were so confusing... It said toilets but there were no toilets, I
tried the two doors there and they were both locked, I walked around the
corner and saw a sign for toilets and when I opened it I saw two old guys with
their penises flopped right out in the open. Why did you tell me to go that way,
Michael?"

"Why would you trust me? I've never been here"

"MICHAEL!!!"


<h4 class="article-subheader">We Just Landed!!!"</h4>
8 hours before Jill's unfortunate water closet mixup the 4 1/2 foot tall
wheels of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner carrying the passengers of Norse Atlantic
flight N02 touched down at Oslo Gardermoen Airport.

Welcome to Norway!!!


"Ok they rebooked us on the 4:15"

The process for rebooking was startlingly smooth despite the throng of
frazzled travelers huddled around the SAS customer service booth. As I approach
the scrum my advanced height affords a favorable vantage to observe the object
of the collective's worship. A stylized aluminum monolith brandished with the
italic uppercase blue <span style="color:#2B3087; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold;">SAS</span> logo bolsters a Microsoft Surface tablet in the
middle stages of a hard reset.

Beside the apparatus stands a SAS customer service representative in a smart,
light blue skirt suit smiling beneath her tight ponytail.

"Our technicians have fixed the problem and the system will be rebooted shortly,
we will be with you in just a moment"

Just then a Microsoft Windows logo appears amidst a blue digital background.
A few seconds later the logo dissolves to reveal a customer service help screen,
a lone button labeled "Customer Service" floating atop a sea of light grey that
can only be described as *Windows 95-esque*. Once it's been determined I've
waited the requisite amount of time based on my arrival time to the queuemob I
press the button and a slip of paper gurgitates from the mouth of the contraption.

**B103**

I pause for just a second to revel in the absurdity of this moment. Scandinavian
Airlines is employing a device with more computing power than
existed on earth when we put a man on the moon to serve the same function as a
roll of perforated paper at a deli counter.

The society of automated machines whirring about in Kurt Vonnegut's 1952 novel
*Player Piano* in the front sleeve of my backpack feels painfully prescient at this
moment. 

I wait about 5 minutes, watching the LED ticker above the booths smoothly
increment their tally through the upper nineties until it reads **B103**.

"Hi, I'm on the 3 PM flight to Bergen with 3 friends but they are still stuck
in the customs line. We're not going to be able to make our flight, would it be
possible to rebook to a later flight?"

I show our reservation details to the representative.

"Ok, there are 4 of you?"

"Yes"

"Ok, you are rebooked on the 4:15 PM flight, is there anything else I can help
you with?"

"No... that was... really helpful, thank you so much... tusen takk"

"V&aelig;r s&aring; god"

20 minutes later my compatriots are finally released from their temporary
imprisonment with 2 hours time served under their belt. We share a round of hugs
and I commiserate with Jill about the monsters that are Shannon & Michael,
notorious plane sleepers who conked out the second the wheels left the tarmac.
Jill suffered through the same planesomnia as I, but seems to be in
much better spirits than I was when I arrived.

"Where's the SAS check in"

"Section 3 - I've had plenty of time to wander around the airport while y'all
were in the customs line. I'm pretty much an expert on the Oslo Gardermoen
domestic departures terminal"

"Ok expert, we have a plane to catch"

The entry to the security checkpoint is guarded by an automated glass gate that
swings open when you scan your boarding pass. We waltz through the gate, plop
our bags on the conveyor and breeze through the metal detector. Not once were
we required to show ID during the whole process. Very trusting people, the
Scandinavians.

As I'm restuffing my belongings into my knapsack Jill peeks at the big board for
our gate number to Bergen.

"Oh, looks like our original flight was canceled"

I divert my attention from my entropy reducing activities and spin around to
face the departures display.

Now, I have no reason to question Jill's reading comprehension or airport
experience but there's something about human nature that subconsciously pulls
my attention away from my entropy reducing activities to wheel around and stare
at the same screen that Jill is peering at.

**Bergen SAS SK271 15:00 CANCELLED**

Satisfied with my own assessment of the situation I pirouette back to Jill, as
if she was waiting with bated breath for my affirmation,

"Oh wow, yeah it is canceled"

There's no way to know but I'm going to believe that their passport control
fiasco benefited us. We got seats all in the same row before anybody else had to
scramble for 

That's the thing about travel mercies. They are mysterious.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Bergen</h4>

Three hours later we are rambling through the streets of Bergen, Norway in a
rented Toyota Corolla crossover, unsure of what any of the street signs mean,

"Am I going the wrong way? What do these signs with a red X going through them
mean? I feel like this is wrong but the GPS says to go this way. I think?"

After a sinuous path through the streets of old Bergen we arrive at our airbnb.




And that's how Jill was introduced to the urinal trough at 
an incredible purveyor of food and beer and an even better purveyor of
efficient effluent expulsion.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Trains Are So Cool</h4>
I have been on a couple trips with Jill. Jill is a fabulous trip companion. Jill
makes spreadsheets of trip plans and activities. We love Jill.

Over rooftop dinner with Big Tom on my first night in Norway I tell him our
plans,

"I'm meeting Shannon, Jill, and Michael at OSL on Saturday



During my first night in Norway, Big Tom 

* Cornelius restaurant
* Funicular train
* Edvard Grieg museum

"Oh! I should add that to the spreadsheet!"



At a quarter to ten we walk out into the vibrant nighttime sunlight of Bergen.
It's bedtime but your body does not want oblige. It's simply too bright for
sleep.

"What time does that railroad close? What is it? Fernilinder? Funrickider?
Fundickaler?"

"Funicular" 

"Fundickular!"

"Close enough"

"Looks like it's open till midnight if we want to check it out"

"Let's do it!"



<h4 class="article-subheader">Fjord Fordin'</h4>
Our plan for the day following our stay in Bergen involves a hike. That's about
the extent of my knowledge of the plans, I'm just along for the ride. Thankfully
I brought hiking boots for just this occasion.

We mosey about after our late night enjoying the midnight sun and trundle onto
the streets of Bergen just before checkout time. We make our way to G&oslash;dt
Br&oslash;d for some breakfast and coffee. Seeing as it's nearly noon our
breakfast consists of deli sandwiches hand crafted to order by perhaps the
nicest Gen Z'er to ever slap mayonnaise on focaccia.

"Here are your coffees, come back when you finish for a free refill!" Helga
(I'm just assuming her name is Helga) cheerily tells us. After Shannon and I
slurp down our coffees (Jill and Michael ordered Americanos and thusly were not
afforded the free refill perk) I ferry our mugs to the counter for our allotted
refills. Upon completion of the second cup Shannon and I get a devious twinkle
in our eyes.

"We should go get another refill right?"

As Shannon is standing at the counter waiting to receive our illicit java a
woman in front of her in line mistakes Shannon's modicum of hap for a hapless
American and flags down the barista. "Can you give this American a refill when
you finish ringing me up" she presumably says in Norwegian, turns and smiles at
Shannon.

"She will help you with the refill in just a moment"

Once satisfied with brekky we walk back to the car in the rain. From all accounts
this seems to be the default weather pattern in Bergen, sitting directly in the
path of moist air from the gulf stream. The rain holds for the first two hours
of the three hour drive to Fl&aring;m, blanketing our view of the fjords
between the myriad tunnels (we drove through _____ tunnels along the way)

As we approach the eastern flank of the *Sognefjord* the rain slowly begins to
lift and we catch our first glimpses of the majesty of the fjords.

Steep walled canyons flanking placid emerald wa-

Sitting dutifully in the driver's seat, Michael is the only occupant of our
coach looking straight ahead. Despite our fixed port-side gazes, Shannon, Jill,
and I can almost assuredly predict when a tunnel is approaching - once Shannon
starts to take a video a tunnel is surely soon to follow.

As we begin the final descent to our destination our red Toyota Corolla cross
emerges from a tunnel to a valley that draws our gaze frontward.

"This must be the Valley of the Waterfalls I read about," Jill declares, the
only one of us who has done advanced scouting of the area.

On either side of the wide valley sprawled before us torrents of water cascade
from their heavenly perch. 


The final tunnel before Fl&aring;m bores 7 miles through the precambrian gneiss
of the southern Scandinavian Mountains, making it the third longest
road tunnel in Norway. Halfway through our subterranean journey the tubular
cavern alights with colorful LEDs, washing the inside of the tunnel in a
rotating series of bright pinks,
purples, blues, and reds. It feels like a dance party might break out at any
moment. As Jill later discovers, the lights were installed to break up the
monotony of the miles upon miles of gray tunnel walls.

The trailhead for our hike sits above the town of Aurland, a stone's throw down
the road from Fl&aring;m. As our Toyota moseys through town Jill recognizes a
landmark from her research,

"Oh! Marianne Bakery! I remember reading about this place, they are supposed to
have amazing cinnamon rolls!"

In silent unison the entire car unanimously approves Jill's motion to adjourn
for cinnamon rolls and Michael smoothly pulls into a parking space across the
street from the bakery. 10 minutes later we are back on the road scarfing down
a round of spiced pastries that exceed even Jill's prodigious expectations. 
Unlike the gooey, hyperglycemic masonry bricks that we're accustomed to,
the *Kanelboller* dispense with the goo and  all your nutmeg, cardamon, allspice,
and, of course, the namesake cinnamon.

Aurland has
a bakery famous for its cinnamon rolls. We stop just on the other side of the
bridge for some carbs to gear up for the hike.

The drive to the trailhead is up a one-lane switchback road overlooking Aurland.
And when I say one-lane I mean *ONE* lane. Uphill and downhill traffic must
manage the single lane in a game of mountainside chicken. We have found ourselves
in the middle of a caravan of RVs and motorcycles, a desirable spot where we
can simply *go with the flow*. Our fearless leader at the front is tasked with
the delicate dance of negotiating oncoming traffic.

Half an hour and a dozen switchbacks later we find ourselves at the trailhead.
As we unload the car we assess the weather to gauge our wardrobe selections.
The sun is poking through mottled clouds, the temperature is hovering right in
the gray area between shortsleeves and long. We're set to climb 2,000 vertical
feet over the course of a mile and three-quarters. We will certainly work up a sweat
on the hike but that will be countered by the cooler temperatures on the
mountain. Will the sun stay out? Is it windy up there?

Sufficiently geared up, we hit the trail. The first half mile of the hike takes
us up a mild grade to the top of a bluff overlooking the *Sognefjord*. If this
was the extent of the hike I'd be thrilled. From even this lower station I'm
afforded what is almost certainly the most stunning view I've ever seen in my life.


We couldn't possibly be going *all the way up there*. It looks an insurmountable
task. 1,500 feet into the azure Norwegian sky, the equivalent of climbing to the
tip of the spire of the Empire state building, each step a fight against the
relentless tug of gravity.

<p class="block-quote">

</p>

Halfway up our heavenly trek the trail winnows down to a slender footpath
perched atop a cliff that wraps around the left side of the craggy mass. At this
point all conversation ceases while our expedition navigates the 50 yard
tightrope maneuver, every ounce of concentration devoted to the
precise placement of every step, grabbing hold to the edge of the cliff like
Jimmy Stewart in *Vertigo*.

The final ascent tracks the moderate pitch of the mountain's shoulder. Patches
of small, vibrant flowers line the path, explosions of yellows, reds, and pinks
spackle the mottled green of the dewy moss. Small fields of snow luxuriate in
shady alcoves, stubbornly clinging to their crystalline structure.

The plateaued summit of Mt Prest  waterlogged with the winter's snowpack.

A cairn stands erect at the R&oslash;yrgrind viewpoint, standing guard over the
Aurlandsfjord. We snap a few photos at the monument before signing the logbook.

While gazing out over the

the weather starts to change. The scattered clouds start to scatter together;
the fjord evaporates behind the veil of a misty fog. Our lofty kingdom
enveloped by a damp grey specter.

And just as quickly as it came it went, the sharp  its only memory the wispy tendrils



<h4 class="article-subheader">Trains Are So Cool, Part Deux</h4>
After our cruise we have a few hours to kill before our 6:30 PM reservation on
the Fl&aring;m Railway. Jill found a reasonable hike that we can walk to right
from town so we strap on our hikin' boots and set off southbound from the town
center. We stroll along the Nedre Brekkevegan in a valley flanked by towering
tree-covered cliffsbestride bucolic farms in a
valley flanked by


The 12-mile railway has been described as "the most
beautiful train journey in the world". Starting at Fl&aring;m, a town of 400 residents at the
southeastern tip of the *Sognefjord*, the railway winds 12.6 miles and 2,841
vertical feet up the Halling Valley to the cozy town of Myrdal.

As the electric beast begins its skyward journey we quickly realize that we
picked the wrong side of the train. Not to say this side is bad, it's just all
the best bits are out the windows across the aisle from our position. In that
station sit two surly septuagenarian women occupying one
third of the inventory of a 6-seat alcove.

Trains are so cool because you can talk about the steepness of a hill like "18
in 1" and say things like "rolling stock".
