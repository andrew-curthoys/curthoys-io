<h4 class="article-subheader">I Just Saw 2</h4>
"Ok... so Michael said to go out and to the right... I went out and to the right
and there was no bathroom so I went down one floor and went to the right and
the signs were so confusing... It said toilets but there were no toilets, I
tried the two doors there and they were both locked, I walked around the
corner and saw a sign for toilets and when I opened it I 

"Why would you trust me? I haven't been to the bathrooms here"

"MICHAEL!!!"


<h4 class="article-subheader">We Just Landed!!!"</h4>
8 hours preceding Jill's unfortunate water closet mixup the [size of the wheels]
wheels of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner carrying the passengers of Norse Atlantic
[flight number] touched down at Oslo Gardermoen Airport.

[text bubble css thing?]

Welcome to Norway!!!

[text about landing and going through passport control]



"Ok they rebooked us on the 4:15"

The process for rebooking was startlingly smooth despite the throng of
frazzled travelers huddled around the SAS customer service booth as I approach.
My advanced heigh offers me a vantage point to see a smiling SAS customer
service representative standing next to a computerized tablet perched atop a
stylized metal _____________.

"Our technicians have fixed the problem and the system will be rebooted shortly,
we will be with you in just a moment"

Just then a Microsoft Windows logo appears amidst a _______ blue background on
the tablet.

The society of automated machines whirring about in Kurt Vonnegut's *Player
Piano* in the front sleeve of my backpack feels very on the nose at this
moment. 

I press the "Customer Service" button and a slip of paper gurgitates from the
mouth of the ________.

**B103**

Scandinavian Airlines is employing a device with more computing power than
existed on earth when we put a man on the moon to serve the same function as a
roll of perforated paper at a deli counter.

I wait about 5 minutes, watching the LED ticker above the booths smoothly
increment their tally through the upper nineties until it reads **B103**.


"Hi, I'm on the 3 PM flight to Bergen with 3 friends but they are still stuck
in the customs line. We're not going to be able to make our flight, would it be
possible to rebook to a later flight?"

I hand my phone with our 3 PM reservation details to the representative.

"Ok, there are 4 of you?"

"Yes"

"Ok, you are rebooked on the 4:15 PM flight, is there anything else I can help
you with?"

"No... that was... really helpful, thank you so much... tusen takk"

"Varsegod"


<h4 class="article-subheader">Bergen</h4>
I'm restuffing my belongings into my knapsack when Jill looks at the big board
to find our gate for our flight to Bergen.

"Oh, looks like our original flight was canceled"

I divert my attention from my entropy reducing activities and spin around to
face the departures display.

[Bergen SAS flight number etc time CANCELLED]

Satisfied with my own assessment of the situation I pirouette back to Jill, as
if she was waiting with bated breath for my affirmation,

"Yeah, looks pretty canceled"

There's no way to know but I'm going to believe that their passport control
fiasco benefited us. We got seats all in the same row before anybody else had to
scramble for 

That's the thing about travel mercies. They are mysterious.

Three hours later we are rambling through the streets of Bergen, Norway in a
rented Toyota Corolla crossover, unsure of what any of the street signs mean,

"Am I going the wrong way? What do these signs with a red X going through them
mean? I feel like this is wrong but the GPS says to go this way. I think?"

After a sinuous path through the streets of old Bergen we arrive at our airbnb.




And that's how Jill was introduced to the urinal trough at 
an incredible purveyor of food and beer and an even better purveyor of
efficient effluent expulsion.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Trains Are So Cool</h4>
I have been on a couple trips with Jill. Jill is a fabulous trip companion. Jill
makes spreadsheets of trip plans and activities. We love Jill.

Over rooftop dinner with Big Tom on my first night in Norway I tell him our
plans,

"I'm meeting Shannon, Jill, and Michael at OSL on Saturday


During my first night in Norway, Big Tom 

* Cornelius restaurant
* Funicular train
* Edvard Grieg museum

"Oh! I should add that to the spreadsheet!"


<h4 class="article-subheader">Mountain Climbers</h4>
Our plan for the day following our stay in Bergen involves a hike. That's about
the extent of my knowledge of the plans, I'm just along for the ride. Thankfully
I brought hiking boots for just this occasion.

We mosey about after our late night enjoying the midnight sun and trundle onto
the streets of Bergen just before checkout time. We make our way to G&oslash;dt
Br&oslash;d for some breakfast and coffee. Seeing as it's nearly noon our
breakfast consists of deli sandwiches hand crafted to order by perhaps the
nicest Gen Z'er to ever slap mayonnaise on focaccia.

"Here are your coffees, come back when you finish for a free refill!" Helga
(I'm just assuming her name is Helga) cheerily tells us. After Shannon and I
slurp down our coffees (Jill and Michael ordered Americanos and thusly were not
afforded the free refill perk) I ferry our mugs to the counter for our allotted
refills. Upon completion of the second cup Shannon and I get a devious twinkle
in our eyes.

"We should go get another refill right?"

As Shannon is standing at the counter waiting to receive our illicit java a
woman in front of her in line mistakes Shannon's modicum of hap for a hapless
American and flags down the barista. "Can you give this American a refill when
you finish ringing me up" she presumably says in Norwegian, turns and smiles at
Shannon.

"She will help you with the refill in just a moment"


<h4 class="article-subheader">Trains Are So Cool, Part Deux</h4>
The Fl&aring;m Railway has been described as "the most beautiful train journey
in the world". Starting at Fl&aring;m, a town of 400 residents at the
southeastern tip of the *Sognefjord*, the railway winds 866 meters (____ ft)
up the ___________ valley to ______________.

It's soon made clear that we picked the wrong side of the train. Not to say this
side is bad, it's just all the best bits are out the windows transverse(?) to
our position. In that station sit two surly septuagenarian women occupying one
third of the inventory of a 6-seat alcove.

Trains are so cool because you can talk about the steepness of a hill like "18
in 1" and say things like "rolling stock".
