I wake up in a fit of dread, realizing that I have to work today. Lame, lame, lame, super lame. I hop in the shower and do a bit more packing before firing up my machine and reluctantly checking my emails. I learn that I have a code of business conduct training course due today, which should be a pretty good airplane activity since United informed me that my bird will have wifi access.

The morning passes uneventfully, mostly catching up on emails and getting settled back in. A couple hours before my flight I finish my packing and have a final chat with Joanne and effusively thank her for the hospitality. I couldn’t think of a better host than Joanne & Greg, they are just the best. Joanne pulls out an old line my grandma Sarah used to say, “come again when you can stay longer.” I tell her to be careful what she wishes for and after a laugh and a hug Greg & I are on the way to SeaTac.

It’s just under half an hour to the airport and the roads are free of traffic. Greg drops me off at the curb, I thank him again, and I head into the terminal. I drop off my boot bag at the United counter and breeze through security. I have about 45 minutes till I board so I fire up my laptop and bang out a little more work. United flight 415 to Houston begins boarding and it’s my last chance to ditch the flight and stay here and become a ski bum. I think about it for a second but step in line for the flight because I’m a coward. I get on the plane and I have an exit row all to myself. At least I have that going for me.

We get into the air and I break out my computer and sprawl across the row. I have to buy two wifi passes because I need to use my phone to authenticate the VPN access on my computer. Kind of a pain in the ass but to be fair the ability to work from 30,000’ in the air is pretty incredible. I finish the code of business conduct training (fyi insider trading is bad you guys) and knock out a few more tasks in the air. The flight is about 4 hours of smooth sailing. We touch down in Houston and after snagging my bag I make the walk to my car.

Dang. This is it, the end of a trip for the record books. I roll down my windows and crank up some Warren Zevon. As I'm making my way out of the garage I almost get sideswiped by a parking shuttle when the driver takes a turn way too sharp. That would not have been fun to deal with right now.

After waiting on some morons who apparently can’t read and get into the wrong lane to leave the garage I’m back at the house in about 30 minutes. I carry my stuff in and unpack my bags. I put my boots away for the season and set my ski clothes aside to launder in the morning. I hang out with Nic for a bit on the couch, watching nonsense and boring him with stories from the trip. Soon enough it’s my bedtime and the trip has finally come to a close. I don’t want the ride to end but what a ride it’s been. Tomorrow the daydream ends and it’s back to the real world.
