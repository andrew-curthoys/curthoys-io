This was too long for a text but a full webpage article is overkill. But it's my
website and I make the rules. So fuck it.

This story begins Thursday evening. My flight from NYC landed at Tulsa
International at 5:30. I took the field for softball at 6:30. Will needed a
fill-in for his lawyer league and I helped a brother out. After the game he
mentions that he has two tickets to a show at Cain's Ballroom & nobody to go
with him.

"Hell I'll go with you.... Who's playing?"

"War On Drugs"

"Hmmmm the name sounds familiar, but I'm not real familiar with them. I'm in
irregardless."

On the drive home from softball I pull them up on Spotify & realize I'm very
familiar with their song *Under the Pressure*, which was on my coding playlist
that I would jam while learning how to code at various San Antonio coffee shops.

Fuck yes. I'd say they'd be somewhere in a Khruangbin/LCD Soundsystem Venn
Diagram. This is gonna kick ass.

Ahead of the show Will and I meet at Caz's Pub a dive bar in downtown that still
allows smoking. It's a true gem. We shuffle through the winos at the bar for a
couple double vodka sodas & plop down at a high top. I get a hankerin' for a
piss and see the first of a few things that make me think "ohhh shit Brady's
gonna love that"

Back at the table I get ready to send you the above photo when I notice the
greatest sports documentary on the television to the left of the hockey game.

Ok, so now I'll have to send you two photos. Then what happens next is when I
realize this story is going to take more than a text. Just have a look.

It's Parley o'clock baby.

Will and I have a discussion about the coolest way to hold & smoke a ciggy &
decide to smoke a second because we haven't come to a consensus. We dump down
our cockies and walk up to Cain's, god's gift to live music.

So we've been to Cain's Ballroom probably 100 times. We have a spot, mid-way up on
the right. When we walk in the place is packed nuts to butts all the way to the
back. I've only seent it this jammed a few times. Will & I grab a beer and post
up near the back by the soundstage.

We watch a few songs & get our nips blown off by the band. I can't understand a
single word the lead singer is saying but I can *feel* it. It's a definite vibe.

We end up doing the things you do at a general admission show, grabbing rounds
of beers, wandering around, pissing. At one point I look over and see our buddy
David, who normally comes over on Sundays to watch Nascar. In fact he's over
here right now. We give each other bear hugs & yell over the music. He agrees to
bring some good potata chips for Nascar but he showed up today empty handed.

Anyways I look back up to the stage, look around, and realize we're in our spot.
We didn't even purposefully move here, it's a subconscious instinct like the
salmon of Capistrano
returning to spawn. The band continues to fucking rock, if
they come through Houston you **need** to go see them. They play a 4 song encore
that brings down the house & we head out to grab a post-show drink.

David says that this local legend, whose name escapes me, is playing at the Hunt
Club, a watering hole just a couple blocks down from the music barn. We're
waiting in line to get in the bar and I see this girl Katie, who is the manager
at American Solera and is friends with my college roommmate Uncle Trojahn.

She gives me a big hug & says her friend who went the show with her bailed so
she's roaming around solo. We go in and I order "two beers, two whiskeys,
dealer's choice." We go out and watch the music for a little, dance a little,
then Miss Katie orders an Uber. She grabs my hand and drags me out to the car,
headed to her place.

You can guess what happens next.
