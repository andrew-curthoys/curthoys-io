    "author": "Sean Carroll",
    "category": "read",
    "genres": ["Physics", "Quantum Mechanics"],
    "summary": "Sean Carroll is one of the best science communicators out there. This book is a distillation of his preferred interpretation of quantum physics, the 'Many Worlds' interpretation. In contrast to the conventional 'Copenhagen Interpretation', which hand-wavily claims that the Schrödinger equation collapses when an observer makes a measurement, the Many Worlds interpretation insists that the Schrödinger equation always holds - it's the entire universe that splits into separate copies. It's a trippy concept but Carroll, as always, does an expert job of making the most complex concepts in physics approachable.",

I read Buford's earlier book, Heat, which chronicled his journey leaving a perfectly good job as an editor at The New Yorker to work as a line cook in a fancy NYC restaurant, which led to an Italian sojourn making artisanal pasta, and a stint with an authentic Italian butcher. This time it's France & he has a family in tow. Bill Buford is a madman and I will read anything he writes.",

I picked this up on a whim at Letters Bookshop, my outstanding local bookstore. Chief Joseph holds a venerated place in the American public consciousness that perhaps only Sitting Bull can rival. I was wholly unaware of the details of the Nez Perce War and I'm looking forward to understanding the details of a man who we've built up as a hero over the years.",

He had just finished it and apparently doesn't have the same hoarding instinct that I do. I started it on the return journey to the States & was immediately engrossed. From the author of the fabulous Killers of the Flower Moon, this tells the story of the shipwreck of a British man-of-war off the southern coast of Chile. Miraculously two separate castaway parties washed ashore months apart on opposite sides of the South American landmass. Shipwreck, mutiny, murder. What's not to love?",

In this epic work, Mukherjee guides the reader on a journey to the beginnings of our understanding of this disease (we meet Galen of course), the long standing attempt to find a cure, and the current state of cancer research. We make detours through Halstead's ill advised radical mastectomy, the advances, setbacks, and deadends of chemotherapy, and the retrospectively wasteful and premature War on Cancer. This is truly a masterpiece and a must read for the layman to understand the difficulties and complexities of dealing with a disease as obstinately pernicious as cancer.",
