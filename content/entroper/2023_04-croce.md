summary: The muggy North Carolina air hangs heavy as I find my seat at the 400 seat Cary Arts Center. I'm just in time to hear AJ Croce finish his opening announcements, "... and I'll try my best to project my voice for everyone there in the back.  "I haven't done this since I was a kid, trying to sing loud enough to convince passersby on the street to duck into an empty barroom.  "And if you know the words help me out and sing along!"

The muggy North Carolina air hangs heavy as I find my seat at the 400 seat Cary
Arts Center. I'm just in time to hear AJ Croce finish his opening announcements,

<i>"... and I'll try my best to project my voice for everyone there in the back.

I haven't done this since I was a kid, trying to sing loud enough to
convince passersby on the street to duck into an empty barroom.

And if you know the words help me out and sing along!"</i>

And with that, AJ Croce begins flawlessly mashing
the flawless keys of a Steinway Model D grand piano. A virtuosic whirlwind of
clattering ivory stands in place of the instantly recognizable opening bass
line of *You Don't Mess Around with Jim*.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Uptown got its hustlers<br>
The bowery got its bums<br>
42nd Street got Big Jim Walker<br>
He's a pool-shootin' son of a gun
</div>

Tonight's show is going to be memorable.

Not just because AJ's father is one of my most beloved songwriters. I have all
three of Jim Croce's studio albums on vinyl & I'm getting close to wearing the
grooves off them.

	record I already had? I sure did. Am I mad about it? Not at all</figcaption>
</figure>

No, tonight is going to be memorable because tonight's show is
going to be a *fully unplugged* acoustic set.

But not by choice.

Just before showtime the theater lost electricity. No microphones. No amps. No
air conditioning. The only illumination of the stage provided by the feeble glow
of a handful of emergency lights.

</figure>

Despite the spartan setting, AJ's treatment of *You Don't Mess Around with Jim*
is a rollicking romp,
supported by a few hundred mostly septuagenarian backup
singers who know most of the verses and every word of the chorus. It feels like
we're all sitting around a campfire, belting out singalongs. I'm just waiting
for someone to pass me a bottle of
whiskey.

Of the hundreds of shows I've attended in my 34 years I can
honestly say this is among the most unique.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
You don't tug on Superman's cape<br>
You don't spit into the wind<br>
You don't pull the mask off the old Lone Ranger<br>
And you don't mess around with Jim
</div>

From the sound of the crowd, a few of my fellow patrons were unawares of the
cuttin' that was done on Big Jim by a South Alabama country boy named Willie
McCoy. A man known to anybody who's darkened the door of a smoky pool hall
simply as Slim.

After a (relatively) rowdy ovation, AJ steps up from the piano and begins
regaling us with the backstory of the next song.

<i>"Dad was in the Army before I was born and at base they
had a bank of pay phones so all the GIs could call their sweethearts.<br>

Now the last booth in the row had a busted door, and dad, being a young aspiring
songwriter, recognized this for the goldmine that it was. Because dad said that
every songwriter knows that there's no better theme for a song... than another
person's tragedy."</i>

As the laughter subsides AJ steps back to the piano and cozies up to the
opening chords of "Operator."

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Operator,<br>
Oh, could you help me place this call?<br>
You see the number on the matchbook<br>
Is old and faded<br>
<br>
She's livin' in LA<br>
With my best old ex-friend Ray<br>
A guy she said she knew well and sometimes hated
</div>

The crowd isn't as familiar with the verses as they were with *Jim* but as the
first chorus comes around the entire audience swells in unison to meet AJ right
outside that Army base phone booth.

Sometimes in life you have those moments that completely sweep you away and
connect you to an emotion that you can't describe but don't want to end.

This is one of those moments.

It sounds dramatic but I absolutely adore Jim Croce. I can't think of any other
way to describe this moment than *magical*.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Isn't that the way they say it goes?<br>
But let's forget all that<br>
<br>
And give me the number if you can find it<br>
So I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine<br>
And to show I've overcome the blow<br>
<br>
I've learned to take it well<br>
I only wish my words could just convince myself<br>
That it just wasn't real<br>
<br>
But that's not the way it feels
</div>

Oh Jim, I wish I had the words to express the way it feels. And I wish
you could see the marvelous talent your sweet little boy has grown into.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Time in a Bottle</h4>
Adrian James Croce was born on the 28th of September, 1971, the son of Jim and Ingrid
Croce. While his father is well known for his songs chronicling mid-century
Americana via blue-collar eccentrics lurking in pool halls, truck stops, and the
grittier fringes of society, his mother was no slouch in the musical department.
Jim & Ingrid toured as a duo for a few years in the late '60s, releasing a
record in 1969.

<figure class="figure">

	<figcaption class="figure-caption">I have that one on vinyl too</figcaption>
</figure>

When news arrived that Ingrid was pregnant with AJ, she decided to settle down and
Jim dedicated himself wholeheartedly to his musical career. Immediately after
learning he was to be a father, Jim penned *Time in a Bottle*, a song about
the unending love he felt for Ingrid & his son-to-be.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
If I could save time in a bottle<br>
The first thing that I'd like to do<br>
Is to save every day till eternity passes away<br>
Just to spend them with you<br>
</div>

Six months after AJ
was born, Jim released his first solo record, *You Don't Mess Around with Jim*.
His sophomore effort, *Life & Times*, released in the summer of 1973, earned him
two nominations at the 1974 Grammys.

That summer, *Bad, Bad Leroy Brown*, the second single from *Life & Times*
reached #1 on the American charts. With a European tour already under his belt,
and appearances on *American Bandstand*, *The Tonight Show*, and *The Dick
Cavett Show* to come later that summer, Jim Croce's star was beginning to rise.

Then on September 20, 1973, while touring the record and just 8 days shy of AJ's
second birthday, the plane carrying Jim Croce and his band crashed shortly after
taking off from Natichitoches, Louisiana. All on board were killed instantly.
Jim Croce was just 30 years old.

That day the American songbook lost one of its greatest poets.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
If I could make days last forever<br>
If words could make wishes come true<br>
I'd save every day like a treasure and then<br>
Again, I would spend them with you

Croce (@ajcroce)</a></p></div></blockquote> <script async src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script>

Unfortunately this was just the first of many cruel blows life was to deal AJ.
At the tender age of 4, his mother's new boyfriend beat him so horrifically that
it left him blind. "It was a very dark and violent period in my life, and it was
very traumatic." During those years he found solace and escape through music.
"I sat at the piano, I played along to the radio, whatever was on my little
transistor radio, whether it was ELO or McCartney or Stones or Elton John."
Eventually regaining sight in his left eye at the age of ten, he never lost his
passion for the piano and songwriting.

For the first few decades of his career AJ avoided his father's music, choosing
to make his own way as a musician. "There were times when maybe as a teenager
where it was a little bit hard to get around the shadow of my father. People had
asked me to record my father's music since I was 16, 17 years old, and I really
was not interested." Asked if having success on his own terms was liberating, AJ
had a one word reply, "absolutely."

His relationship with the Jim Croce catalog began to change about a dozen years
ago, when he began digitizing his father's recordings. One old casette contained
a bar performance of his old man playing blues riffs by artists
such as Mississippi John Hurt, Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee, and Blind Blake. AJ
was amazed because these were the same artists that he been playing since he
was a youngster, completely unaware of the shared influence with his father.

Speaking of the sparse memories he has of his father, AJ says "You know, I have
this memory of the warmth of embrace, you know? And while it’s not visual for
me, it’s palpable." After 25 years of trying to escape his father's considerable
musical shadow, AJ realized that it wasn't a shadow at all, but a warm, loving
embrace. AJ has since begun to work his father's music into his performances,
delighting in the joy it brings audiences. On this tour, *Croce Plays Croce*, AJ
blends beloved Jim Croce classics and his own original songs with tunes that
influenced both of them.

After decades of establishing himself as a musician and coming
to grips as the son of a famous father he never knew, AJ endured yet another
biblical-level tragedy. In 2018 he lost his beloved wife Marlo of 24 years
suddenly & unexpectedly of a rare heart virus. Through this unimaginable
heartache he displayed the remarkable stoicism that has helped him navigate
life's tribulations and defined his approach to the human experience.

"When we lose someone we love, whether it was my father, my wife, my sight, we
can decide how we want to bring it into our life. Do we want to dwell on it? Do
we want to find the best part of that person, that experience, and keep it with us?"

After *Operator* AJ dives into a piano riff that's not quite ragtime,
not quite funk, but undeniably raucous. We're lucky the fire department is in
the building checking on the power because AJ's piano is liable to combust
at any second.

After a good 5 minutes of grand piano gas that could make your shoulders bob in
a straitjacket, AJ and the band slide into Billy Preston's *Nothing From Nothing*.
AJ accompanies what Preston called "saloon piano"
with a foot stomp that deftly substitutes for a bass drum all night. Fun fact:
*Nothing from Nothing* was the first song ever played on
SNL. Keep that in your mind palace for your next trivia night.

Before the next tune, a cover of Sam Cooke's *Nothing Can Change This Love*, AJ
tells a story from the early days of his touring career. Floyd Dixon, an
aficionado of a musical style called jump blues,
tapped AJ to open for him at the youthful age of 16 (Before his 21st birthday AJ
would have toured with the likes of Ray Charles, BB King, Taj Mahal, Aretha
Franklin, the Neville Brothers, and Willie Nelson).

AJ recounts a story about an infamous night Floyd spent with
Sam Cooke & Ray Charles. As Floyd told it, the three of them were out all night,
burning the candle at both ends. Now, Floyd was the author of the booze-soaked
blues classic *Hey Bartender*, so you ain't gotta be Hercule Poirot to deduce
the condition they were in by the wee hours of the morning.

At this point I'm just going to recommend you see AJ in concert to hear the
rest of the story. The way these three amigos got the car home is worth the
price of admission.

AJ's performance of Cooke's soul ballad is unsurprisingly breathtaking. This
song, along with many of the covers he plays tonight can be found on his 2021 album
<a href="https://www.discogs.com/master/2001637-AJ-Croce-By-Request" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">By Request</a>. His first record
after the tragic loss of his wife, it's a cathartic trip down memory lane. The title
refers to songs that he's frequently played at the request of friends & family
during late night soirées he & Marlo hosted. The twelve songs
on the record are some of his favorite crowd pleasers. As a
testament to his diverse musical interests and protean skill, the
record is listed under the genres of Rock, Latin, Funk / Soul, Pop,
Folk, World, & Country.

In his own words:
"There are few parts of American music that haven’t influenced me at
one time or another. Fats Waller, James P. Johnson, Ray
Charles, Mose Allison, the Band, Woody Guthrie, Hank Williams,
Memphis Slim, Tom Waits. I just like music in general."

<h4 class="article-subheader">Life & Times</h4>
The middle section of the show features a few hits from his father's
anthology. The audience sings along to *Roller Derby Queen* and *Workin' at the
Carwash Blues*, assisted by the booming voice of bassist David Barard. After the
latter ditty, AJ regales the audience of his old man's penchant for lengthy song
titles, nothing the original title was *I Got Them Steadily Depressin', Low
Down, Mind Messin', Workin' at the Carwash Blues*. The executives at ABC Records
decided that the abridged title would fit better on a record sleeve.

AJ then hops off the piano bench and grabs a guitar for an intimate rendition of
*One Last Set of Footsteps*

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
And we've been hidin' from somethin'<br>
That should have never gone this far<br>
But after all it's what we've done<br>
That makes us what we are<br>
<br>
But tomorrow's a dream away<br>
And today has turned to dust<br>
Your silver tongue has turned to clay<br>
And your golden rule to rust<br>
<br>
If that's the way that you want it<br>
Oh that's the way I want it more<br>
Cause baby one less set of footsteps<br>
On your floor in the mornin'
</div>

At the conclusion of this heartrending breakup song, AJ takes a moment
to chronicle a bit of history about his
dad's band. In the early days of his solo career, Jim Croce met a young
musical virtuoso named Maury Muehelsen. Classically trained in piano, Maury
picked up the guitar at the age of 17 and quickly became a sensation in the
music world. Jim originally wanted Maury to back him up on guitar
but soon promoted Maury to lead guitar despite his meager 22 trips around the sun.

While Maury was a world class talent, his reserved demeanor engendered a
reluctance for the spotlight. Letting Jim assume the role of frontman was just
fine by him. When their plane went down on that fateful day in September, Maury
was just 24 years old. So every guitar lick - from the hard charging riffs
of *Rapid Roy (The Stock Car Boy)*, to the tender, lithesome finger picking
of *I'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song* - was laid down by a man not yet old
enough to rent a car.

AJ's denouement to the story reveals the mind bending fact
that his dad's entire catalog was written, recorded, and toured
in a span of 18 months.

Audible gasps are heard throughout the theater. Including one from yours truly.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Rapid Roy (The Stockcar Boy)</h4>
In a musical nod to Maury, AJ's lead guitarist James Pennebaker lays into the
rock & roll riff from *Rapid Roy* that you'd assume sprang
from the fretboard of Chuck Berry.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Oh Rapid Roy, that stock car boy<br>
He's too much to believe<br>
<br>
You know he always got an extra pack of cigarettes<br>
Rolled up in his t-shirt sleeve<br>
<br>
He got a tattoo on his arm that say "baby"<br>
He got another one that just say "hey"<br>
<br>
But every Sunday afternoon he is a dirt track demon<br>
In a '57 chevrolet
</div>

Swap out the '57 Chevrolet for a '17 Nissan and you've got a pretty good idea
what my drive to the show tonight was like. Unlike Rapid Roy, who drove so fast
because he was runnin' 'shine outta Alabam', my white knuckle automotive demonry
came down to a simple case of careless time management.

The day started on a snaky stretch of road near my office, collecting trash with
some coworkers in honor of Earth Day (I'm still waiting on a call from the
folks at the Goldman Environmental Prize). We gathered 4 vodka bottles, 2
tequila bottles, dozens of cans of malted
beverages of questionable quality, a piece of a bumper, a metal chair, and piles
of broken glass, potato chip bags, and various other pieces of general flotsam.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
That's the sound of the men<br>
Workin' on the chain gang<br>
All day long they work so hard<br>
Till the sun is goin' down<br>  
Working on the highways and byways<br>
And wearin', wearin' a frown
</div>

</figure>

After sticking around for pizza, beer, and a few games of ping pong, my only
pre-show errand was down the road a piece in Chapel Hill. There I would pick up
my race packet for the Tar Heel 10 Miler tomorrow that I foolishly signed up for
with some friends.

On the way I couldn't help but notice the climbing gym on my route so I ducked
in for a few quick routes. A few quick routes turned into many after I bumped
into a friend. One particularly precarious route almost ended my race before it
began when my heel hook got a little too hooked and yanked my hip joint
around in its socket as I ejected from the wall.

Limping out of the gym I offhandedly glance at the time. 5:57 PM. Some quick
mental math reveals I've nonchalantly gotten myself in quite a pickle - half
hour to Chapel Hill, another half hour home, then 30 more minutes to the 7:30
show. Not much wiggle room I've left myself.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
There never seems to be enough time<br>
To do the things you want to do<br>
Once you find them
</div>

I step on it to Chapel Hill, grab my race packet, and zip home, scarfing down
a couple slices of leftover pie and weaving through traffic like Speedball
Tucker, terror of the highway & all them other truckers.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Well, he looked me in the eye as he was writin' me up<br>
He said, "Driver, you been flyin'<br>
And 95 is the route you was on<br>
It was not the speed limit sign"
</div>

I pull up to my apartment and from the time I park, run inside, shower, change,
and run back out to the car all of 10 minutes have passed. That's gotta be some
sort of record.

My ETA to the Cary Arts Center is exactly 7:30. Anticipating the demographics
of the audience, I imagine they'll start pretty much on time. Say what you will
about the elderly but they are punctual.

Just as the clock strikes half past 7 I pull up to the Cary Arts Center to a
throng of seniors gathered on the theater steps like high
school hoodlums from a James Dean flick. Well at least I haven't missed the
start of the show.

I have a hell of a time finding parking, finally finding a single vacant spot at
the elementary school down the road. I wander up to the crowd and ask a group of
folks what's going on.

"Power's out. No lights, no A/C."

"Oh dang, have they said what the plan is?"

"They got some generators running but they only power the emergency lights,
still waiting to hear what they are going to do."

"Well hell."

As I begin to mull about, I notice a gathering of food trucks and tents a
few blocks down the road. Since I have nothing better to do I set off to
investigate.

As I'm waiting to cross the street I meet a friendly couple who assumes that
nobody my age could possibly be going to the AJ Croce concert.

"Do you want a ticket to this show tonight?"

"Oh I already have a ticket. Two actually, I couldn't convince any of my friends
to come."

"Oh ok, we think we might just head home, we saw him last fall and don't feel
like sitting in a theater with no A/C. We're glad we got to see him last fall,
he was fabulous!"

I was hoping to attend that show in Durham but was unfortunately out of town. But
I don't care if they run the heat on full blast tonight I'm not missing this show.
For now I stroll down to the Cary Night Market to find an assortment of food
trucks and local artists vending their wares.

I wander 'round the market, then up to the old main street of Cary before making
an about face back to the theater. As I get closer I see the gang of elderly
miscreants has dispersed from the theater stairs. Either the show is going on
or we've been postponed/canceled. Only one way to find out.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Rollin' On</h4>
About an hour into the show AJ shouts 9 words that engage a
subconscious reflex deep within my soul that results in a primal yawp that
some in the audience may have mistaken for a fire alarm.

*"These next two songs I co-wrote with Leon Russell"*

I almost leap out of my seat and hit the ceiling in a ferocious ball of
excitement. I thought there was no way this night could have possibly gotten
more magical and now we have a collaboration with Cousin AJ & Uncle Leon??

In the (approximate) words of AJ,

<i>"After playing a few shows with Leon he asks me one night,

'Hey I hear your old man played music too'

'Yeah, he had some pretty big hits back in the early '70s, "Bad Bad LeRoy Brown,
"You Don't Mess Around With Jim", "Operator"?'

'Ah ok'

...He had never heard any of them

But a few weeks later he calls me and says 'hey, I'd like to write some songs
with you, send me some music and I'll write the lyrics'

"So that afternoon I put down a groove & send it to Leon and he comes back with
about 15 verses, 3 or 4 options for the chorus, and a couple different choices
for the bridge.

In about an hour.

So I talk with my producer and I say, 'how am I supposed to record this, it
would be a 20 minute song!'

And he says, 'yeah that's just what Leon does, find the story and we'll record
that'

So I picked out the parts of the song that spoke to me and this is what we
ended up with. I wrote the music, Leon wrote the lyrics, except for the chorus,
which is pretty simple, it's "just keep rollin' on", so when we get there I'll
need your help singing it."</i>

So we oblige, singin' along to the chorus while breaking open another pack of
'mallows 'round the fire.

The end of *Rollin' On* smoothly blends into another original tune. *Judgement Day*
is a genre-bending cyclone, tossing turn of the century Gospel lyrics into a
roiling stew of fast-paced Latin salsa piano. AJ is like a man possessed on the
keys, his drummer Gary Mallaber keeping time on the snare and cymbal.

<h4 class="article-subheader">I Got A Name</h4>
With the show winding down AJ breaks into another original tune called *The Time Is
Up*. After the first chorus he leans over from the piano for a quick aside,
"don't worry, the time isn't up *just* yet, we have a few more songs left."

A few songs come and go and AJ has one more story to tell. Once again
we're back at the home of AJ & Marlo Croce, late in the night at one of their
famous f&ecirc;tes.

<i>"Marlo and I loved hosting our friends, it brought us so much joy to entertain
the people we adored late into the night. Sometimes too late! But everyone here
who's hosted a party knows there gets to be a point in the night when you just
want to shout *'ok this has been fun, but can all of you get the hell out of my
house!'* This song, *So Much Fun* is about that point in the night."</i>

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Everybody loves a party<br>
Party favors passed around<br>
I got a few friends<br>
Who burn at both ends<br>
Until they come crashing down<br>
They ride rails til the wheels fall off<br>
And everybody’s out of blow<br>
<br>
It’s so much fun to see ‘em come<br>
But man it’s good to see ‘em go
</div>

As the song wraps up the band takes a bow and ducks behind the curtain. Since we
find ourselves in such a bizarre concert situation and the audience averaging
twice my age I'm dubious of the prospects for an encore. But as much as
I have been ribbing my more experienced concert comrades I have to respect their
dedication. Despite the show starting an hour late and it likely being way past
many of their bedtimes (sorry, I couldn't help myself) the crowd rises to their
feet for a full standing ovation.

The band isn't behind the curtain long before emerging for one last song.

AJ thanks the audience and tells a quick story,

<i>"Thank you all again for coming out tonight and bearing with us. I have to say
this is one of the weirdest shows I've ever performed. Special. But weird.

This last song we'll play for you is actually the only song of my dad's that I've
recorded myself. There's an interesting throughline that ties the two recordings.
The original song was written by a guy by the name of Charlie Fox, who
wrote it as the theme song for a stock car racing movie called *The Last
American Hero*. The song that I recorded was used in a Goodyear commercial with
a stock car racer some of you might have heard of, Dale Earnhardt Jr.

It's a song that reminds me, every time I think of it, every time I play it,
that everything in this world is connected. And I think that's beautiful."</i>

As James Pennebaker's pick strums once across the strings I instantly notice the
tune. It's my Jim Croce gateway drug. The song that led me to superfandom. *I
Got A Name*. The first time I heard this hypnotic melody was in a movie
theater, during a screening of *Django Unchained*. About halfway through the
flick Tarantino shoots a montage of Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz ahorseback,
galloping in slow motion below snow capped peaks.

The needle dropped on the song (literally - Tarantino actually used a vinyl
record from his collection for this scene) and I immediately thought to
myself "holy shit, who the hell is belting out this angelic tune?"

I wasn't 2 steps out of the theater before I looked up the song.
*I Got A Name, Jim Croce*. Oh, Jim Croce? Isn't he the LeRoy Brown guy? I
should listen to more of his songs.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Like the pine trees linin' the windin' road<br>
I've got a name, I've got a name<br>
<br>
Like the singin bird and the croakin' toad<br>
I've got a name, I've got a name<br>
</div>

Ever since that day at the movies I've been enamored with Jim Croce. I started
with the hits, your *Don't Mess Around with Jim*s, your *LeRoy Brown*s, and
have since dug into the deep cuts. Do I have a favorite song? I wouldn't say so,
it's more of how I'm feeling at the time. Right now, for whatever reason, I find
myself in a *Box #10* kind of mood.

AJ reaches the first chorus,
<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
And I carry it with me like my Daddy did<br>
But I'm livin' the dream that he kept hid<br>
<br>
Movin' me down the highway<br>
Rollin' me down the highway<br>
Movin' ahead so life won't pass me by
</div>

And the emotions return. This time mostly gratitude for the opportunity to
spend a strange, intimate, magical evening with the son of one of my musical
heroes.

In that moment I think to myself, AJ is absolutely right.

Everything is connected.

And it is beautiful.
