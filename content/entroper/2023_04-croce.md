Nothing can change this love Sam Cooke  
So Much Fun - to see them go

<h4 class="article-subheader">Friday Night, Feelin' Right</h4>
I find my seat at the Cary Arts Center just as AJ is finishing his announcements,
"... and I'll try my best to project my voice, I hope you can hear me, if you
know the words sing along!"

And with that AJ starts slamming down the keys of his beautiful grand piano,
substituting the instantly recognizable bass line with some virtuosic ivory tickling.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Uptown got its hustlers<br>
The bowery got its bums<br>
42nd Street got Big Jim Walker<br>
He's a pool-shootin' son of a gun
</div>

Tonight's going to be a different kind of show. Not just because I've nearly
worn the grooves off the Jim Croce albums I own.AJ's father is
one of my most beloved songwriters, nearly wearing the grooves off his 3 studio
albums I own. Tonight is going to be full unplugged acoustic.
But that's not by choice. Just before showtime the theater lost power. No
microphones. No amps. The only illumination emanating from a handful of feeble emergency lights.

It's a rollicking romp, most of the crowd singing the verses and all of the
crowd belting out the chorus. It feels like we're all sitting around a campfire,
<singing?> singalongs. I'm just waiting for someone to pass me a bottle of
whiskey. I've been to hundreds of shows in my 34 years and I can
honestly say this is the most unique concert experience I've ever been a part of.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
You don't tug on Superman's cape<br>
You don't spit into the wind<br>
You don't pull the mask off the old Lone Ranger<br>
And you don't mess around with Jim
</div>

From the sound of the crowd, a few of my fellow patrons were unawares of the
cuttin' that was done on Big Jim by a South Alabama country boy named Willie
McCoy, who everybody knows, goes by Slim.


After a rowdy ovation, AJ steps up from the piano and begins regaling us with
the backstory to the next song.

"Dad was in the Army before I was born and they had a bank of pay phones at the
base, and the last one in the row had a busted door. So you could hear
everything that the soldier was saying. Now dad knew he wanted to be a
songwriter, and realized that he just stumbled onto a goldmine. Because
every songwriter knows that there's no better theme for a song than another
person's tragedy."

After delivering the punchline AJ steps back to the piano and after the laughter
dies down starts into the opening chords of "Operator."

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Operator<br>
Oh, could you help me place this call?<br>
You see the number on the matchbook<br>
Is old and faded
</div>

The crowd isn't as familiar with the verses as they were with "Don't Mess Around
with Jim" but as the first chorus comes around the entire audience swells to
meet AJ in full throat. I'm not being hyperbolic when I say that it gives me
chills. It's a downright surreal feeling. 

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Isn't that the way they say it goes?<br>
But let's forget all that<br>
<br>
And give me the number if you can find it<br>
So I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine<br>
and to show I've overcome the blow<br>
<br>
I've learned to take it well<br>
I only wish my words could just convince myself<br>
That it just wasn't real<br>
<br>
But that's not the way it feels
</div>

Oh Jim, I wish I had the words to express how I feel right now. And I wish you
could see the talent your sweet little boy has grown into.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Time in a Bottle</h4>
AJ Croce was born on the 28th of September, 1971 the son of Jim and Ingrid
Croce. While his father is well known for his influential musical catalog, his
mother was no slouch in the musical department, touring with Jim as the duo
*Jim & Ingrid Croce* and releasing their eponymous record in 1969.

When news that Ingrid was pregnant with AJ came, she decided to settle down and
Jim dedicated himself wholeheartedly to his musical career. Six months after AJ
was born, he released his first solo record, *You Don't Mess Around with Jim*.
His sophomore effort, *Life & Times*, released in the summer of 1973, earned him
two nominations at the 1974 Grammys.

That summer, *Bad, Bad Leroy Brown*, the second single from *Life & Times*
reached #1 on the American charts. WIth a European tour already under his belt,
and appearances on *American Bandstand*, *The Tonight Show*, and *The Dick
Cavett Show* to come later that summer, Jim Croce's star was beginning to rise.

On September 20, 1973, while touring his record and just 8 days shy of AJ's
second birthday, Jim Croce was killed in a plane crash in Natichitoches,
Louisiana.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
If I could save time in a bottle<br>
The first thing that I'd like to do<br>
Is to save every day till eternity passes away<br>
Just to spend them with you<br>
<br>
If I could make days last forever<br>
If words could make wishes come true<br>
I'd save every day like a treasure and then<br>
Again, I would spend them with you
</div>

These lyrics were written by Jim Croce about AJ and his mother Ingrid.

Croce (@ajcroce)</a></p></div></blockquote> <script async src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script>

This was merely the beginning of the hardship that AJ would have to endure.
At the tender age of 4, he was blinded as a result of abuse from his mother's
new boyfriend. He found solace and escape in the piano. Eventually regaining
sight in his left eye at the age of ten, his passion for the piano and
songwriting never abated.

For the first few decades of his career AJ avoided his father's music, choosing
to make his own way as a musician. His relationship with his father's music
began to change around a
dozen years ago, when he began digitizing his father's recordings. One old
casette contained a bar performance of Jim Croce playing blues riffs by artists
such as Mississippi John Hurt, Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee, and Blind Blake. AJ
was amazed because these were the same artists that influenced him that he had
been playing since he was 12.

play the piano with everyone from Ray Charles to Willie Nelson; and develop his own reputation as a songwriter. If he hadn't found a way to fully escape the shadow of his father, he figured out a way to live adjacent to it.

Axelrod asked, "Having your own success on your own terms was liberating?"

"Absolutely." 

Speaking of the sparse memories he has of his father, AJ says "You know, I have
this memory of the warmth of embrace, you know? And while it’s not visual for
me, it’s palpable." After 25 years of trying to escape his father's considerable
musical shadow, AJ realized that it wasn't a shadow at all, but a warm, loving
embrace. AJ has since begun to work his father's music into his performances,
delighting in the joy it brings audiences. On this tour, *Croce Plays Croce*, AJ
blends beloved Jim Croce classics and his own original songs with tunes that
influenced both of them.

"When we lose someone we love, whether it was my father, my wife, my sight, we can decide how we want to bring it into our life. Do we want to dwell on it? Do we want to find the best part of that person, that experience, and keep it with us?" 




<h4 class="article-subheader">Rapid Roy (The Stockcar Boy)</h4>
Is a dirt track demon in a '57 Chevrolet. Well this afternoon I'm a paved track
demon in '17 Nissan. It may not be a
'57 Chevrolet, but I'm booking it nonetheless. The reason I find myself in this
particular predicament comes down to careless time management.

The day started on the side of the snaky stretch of road outside our office,
gathering refuse with my coworkers in honor of Earth Day. (Where can I pick up
my Nobel Prize?) I stuck around for pizza and beer after collecting a few 100
gallon bags full
of 4 vodka bottles, 2 tequila bottles, untold cans of malted beverages of
questionable quality, a piece of a bumper, a metal chair, and piles of broken
glass, potato chip bags, and various other pieces of general flotsam.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang<br>
All day long they work so hard till the sun is goin' down<br>  
Working on the highways and byways and wearin', wearin' a frown
</div>

My next errand is down the road a piece in Chapel Hill, to pick up my race
packet for the Tar Heel 10 Miler run tomorrow that I foolishly signed up for
with some friends. On the way I make a pit stop at the climbing gym for a few
easy routes, one particularly precarious route that almost ended my run before
it began when my heel hook got a little too hooked and yanked my hip joint
around in its socket when I ejected from the wall.

As I limp out of the gym I do a double take at the time. It's almost 6 now,
it's half an hour to Chapel Hill, another half hour home, then 30 more minutes
to the show. That means I'm already late for the 7:30 show time. I've been just
casually enjoying my afternoon without even realizing it got away from me.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
There never seems to be enough time<br>
To do the things you want to do<br>
Once you find them
</div>

I step on it to Chapel Hill, grab my race packet, and zip home, scarfing down
a couple slices of leftover pie and weaving through traffic like Speedball
Tucker, terror of the highway & all them other truckers.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Well, he looked me in the eye as he was writin' me up<br>
He said, "Driver, you been flyin'<br>
And 95 is the route you was on<br>
It was not the speed limit sign"
</div>

I pull up to my apartment and from the time I park, run inside, shower, change,
and run back out to the car all of 10 minutes have passed. That's gotta be some
sort of record.

My ETA to the Cary Arts Center is exactly 7:30. Anticipating the demographics
of the audience, I imagine they'll start pretty much on time. Say what you will
about the elderly but they are punctual.

Just as the clock strikes half past 7 I pull up to the Cary Arts Center to a
crowd of septuagenarians gathered on the steps outside the theater like high
school hoodlums from a James Dean flick. Well at least the show hasn't started.

I have a hell of a time finding parking, finally finding a single vacant spot at
the elementary school down the road. I wander up to the crowd and ask a group of
folks what's going on.

"Power's out. No lights, no A/C."

"Oh dang, have they said what the plan is?"

"They got some generators running but they only power the emergency lights,
still waiting to hear what they are going to do."

"Well hell."

As I take a seat on the steps I notice a gathering of food trucks and tents a
few blocks down the road. Since I have nothing better to do I set off to
investigate.

As I'm waiting to cross the street a friendly couple who assumes that nobody my
age could possibly have come to Cary to see AJ Croce 

"Do you want a ticket to this show tonight?"

"Oh I already have a ticket. Two actually, I couldn't convince any of my friends
to come."

"Oh ok, we think we might just head home, we saw him last fall and don't feel
like sitting in a theater with no A/C. We're glad we got to see him last fall,
he was fabulous!"

I was hoping to attend that show in Durham but was unfortunately out of town.
I'm seeing this show tonight, A/C or not. For now I stroll down to the Cary
Night Market, an assortment of food trucks and local artists vending their
wares. I have a peculiar weak spot for cutting boards and the fact that my car
is a formidable hike away is the only thing that keeps me from parting with my
money in exchange for a beautiful cherry/maple cutting board.

I wander the market then up to the old main street of Cary before making an
about face back to the theater. As I get closer I see the gangs of elderly
miscreants has dispersed from the theater stairs. Either the show is going on
or we've been postponed/canceled. Only one way to find out.



<h4 class="article-subheader">Rollin' On</h4>
About 30 minutes into the show AJ shouts 9 words that engage a
subconscious reflex deep within my soul that results in a primal yawp that
some in the audience may have mistaken for a fire alarm.

"These next two songs I co-wrote with Leon Russell"

I almost leap out of my seat and hit the ceiling in a ferocious ball of
excitement. I thought there was no
way this night could have possibly gotten more magical and now we have a
collaboration with Cousin AJ & Uncle Leon??

"After playing a few shows with Leon he asks me one night,

'Hey I hear your old man played music too'

'Yeah, he had some pretty big hits back in the early '70s, "Bad Bad LeRoy Brown,
"You Don't Mess Around With Jim", "Operator"?'

'Ah ok'

He had never heard any of them

But a few weeks later he calls me and says 'hey, I'd like to write some songs
with you, send me some music and I'll write some lyrics'

"So that afternoon I put down a groove & send it to Leon and he comes back with
about 15 verses, 3 or 4 options for the chorus, and a couple different choices
for the bridge.

In about an hour.

So I talk with my producer and I say, 'how am I supposed to record this, it
would be a 20 minute song!'

And he says, 'yeah that's just what Leon does, find the story and we'll record
that'

So I picked out the pieces of the song that spoke to me and this is what we
ended up with. I wrote the music, Leon wrote the lyrics, except for the chorus,
which is pretty simple, it's 'just keep rollin' on', so when we get there I'll
need your help singing it."

<h4 class="article-subheader">I Got A Name</h4>
As the show is winding down AJ begins to regale us with a story of the last
song of the night.

"This is a song that 


As James Pennebaker's pick strums once across the strings I instantly notice the
tune. It's my gateway drug. The song that led me to Jim Croce superfandom. The
first time I heard "I Got A Name" was in a movie theater, during a
montage of Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz galloping in the shadow of snow
capped peaks during *Django Unchained*. The song came on and I thought to
myself 'holy shit, who the hell is this belting out this angelic tune?'

The first thing I did after leaving the theater was to look up the soundtrack.
*I Got A Name, Jim Croce*. Oh, Jim Croce? Isn't he the LeRoy Brown guy?





Bass player is playing guitar, the only bass we have is AJ's foot stompin' to
keep time




Each time they begin tuning their guitars I can tell which song they are
about to play. 




AJ says "doit track demon" with a Philly accent just like his old man.
