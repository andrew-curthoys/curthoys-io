A story in how 7 words can change your life

I open my Instagram to find a message from my wonderful cousin Laura, who I have

with a link entitled **Audition for "This Land Is Your Land" by Mark Haim.**
The was casting call(?) was posted by the American Dance Festival, the Durham
based dance company that hosts a dance festival every summer.

January 30th
Deadline March 6th
-I have over a month, plenty of time

Requirements: 
* 150 word biography.
* A short description why you want to partake in this performance.
* Headshot.

To most people this probably seems like a piece of cake. Knock it out between
walkin' the dogs & fixin' supper. But for a habitual overthinker it ain't so
easy. I just finished writing 90,000 words about a ski trip, so a
150 word bio is a linguistical economy I can only aspire to. Then as
to why I want to participate in this process and perform this piece? Where do I
even begin? And then the headshot makes me feel like Kevin McCallister when he
has to pack his suitcase.

SUBMIT.

A HEADSHOT!?

Woof.

Well at least I have a month to think it all over.

So I spend the month *thinking* and not a minute of *doing*.

As the March 6 deadline looms ever more sinister with each passing day I realize
my window to snag a headshot before I leave for my Utah ski trip on March 3rd is
rapidly closing. While working from home before my evening flight I spend my
entire lunch break struggling to snap an adequate headshot.

It started with a simple "headshot examples" google image search. A panoply of
aggressively beautiful people suddenly appear on my phone screen. Ok so all I
have to do is look natural and find a nice set of high cheekbones and chiseled
jaw in my size. I have a great exposed brick wall and a skylight so the lighting
should be

The most jarring thing of the entire experience was the amount of grease my
forehead can generate in a single morning of staring at a computer screen.

So the light is too bright. I need some sort of shade. So I take a quick
inventory and find the perfect technological implement for my situation.

A used pizza box.



I spent a stupid amount of time getting a headshot. Pizza box.


Left for ski trip Friday evening March 3
Deadline was Monday March 6.



<h4 class="article-subheader">The Performance Contains Nudity</h4>
This line in the audition call intrigued me the most. What exactly does "contains
nudity" mean? Does *contains nudity* fall on a performance nudity scale that I'm
unaware of? Suggests nudity - teases nudity - flashes
nudity - contains nudity - features nudity - showcases nudity - celebrates nudity.


The Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition Volume III Cham-Creeky published
Clarendon Press, 1989, lists no
fewer than 17 definitions for the word "contains." The most pertinent for our
purposes are probably

2.
	a. To have as part (or the whole) of its contents or substance; to comprise,
include.
	b. Of a material body or substance: To have in it (as a constituent element or
	in combination)
3.
	a. To include, comprise, extend over, measure.

but then we also have definitions 

11.
	a. To restrain, hold in, keep in check; to hold back, keep back, hinder.
	b. To restrain, put restraint on, repress
12. To restrict, limit, confine.

Which is it?

"Once you have watched the video, respond to this email by **tomorrow, March 7**
to confirm that you will be in attendance at the audition.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Audition</h4>
As someone who's never auditioned for anything I have no idea what to expect. I
tried out for baseball when I was 10 but I don't think cranking dingers is gonna
help me today.

What do I wear? I picked a pair of breathable trousers and a plain dark v-neck.
The only wardrobe instruction we received for the audition was a pair of white
soled sneakers, so I opted for the pair of white Asics I wore to officiate
my good friends Brady & Shelby's wedding last summer. Maybe they got some
magic in them yet.

Raining before original audition.

I arrive at 5:40 and check in with Kelsey, who hands me number 170 to pin to my
shirt. Which can only mean one thing: I'm going to be the dancing equivalent of
Josh Allen at this audition, only 10 times better. They snap a quick picture,
ostensibly to get a photo with my number, but most likely because my headshot was
so amateurish.

I drop my bag on a bench in the reception area and tentatively stroll into the
studio. A dozen or so people are scattered around the studio in various states
of stretching and mild calisthenics. I find a vacant patch of studio real estate
and do as the Romans do. My stretches would be considered by even the most
generous of observers as *half assed*. Have I mentioned I don't know what I'm
doing?

By the third time around I start to kind of get the hang of it. A slight
glimmer of *y'know what? maybe I **can** do this*

Then Mark hits us with the gallops.

The gallop is an easy enough maneuver to execute on its own. A variation on the
skip where you raise your front leg during the little hop instead of bringing
your other leg through. I could gallop up & down the studio no problem. The
thing about the gallop, though, is it switches your feet. Instead of right foot
odds, left foot evens we've entered the unfamiliar and sinister world of
left-foot odds, right-foot evens. I cringe just thinking about it.

What's more, my cozy world of RFO-LFE is further upended by the fact that
switching feet means we switch the direction of our pivot.

**But** only on the laps with odd numbers of gallops.

I stand no chance.

We do a couple up & backs as a group then Mark lines us back up to do it in
unison. I take one step and my brain freezes. I hop, I lurch, I trundle. But I
sure as hell don't gallop. The once steady count in my head viciously sublimates,
forever lost to the steady, growing entropy of the universe. My grasp on the
very concept of numbers has become unsettlingly tenuous.

After a few rounds of gallops I glance over at the woman who is galloping with
the ease of Secretariat, my eyes as wide as saucers,

"I have NO idea what I'm doing."

"You're doing pretty good!" Renay lies.

"I've never auditioned for anything before so all this is completely new to me"

"

We work through a handful of other maneuvers(?): the Sally - a jaunty, carefree
frolic of a strut that's so fun to do you can't help but smile. The Lewiston -
a stiff, __________ gait that reminds me of a wrestling coach.

Mark colors each character with a story of an interaction with that individual
or an archetype of the character. With each story I know exactly the person he's
describing.


"Anybody want to go grab a beer?" I say to nobody and everybody all at once.

"Yeah, where were you thinking?" Dana cheerfully replies.

"Hell I don't care."

"Well I'm headed to Accordion Club if you want to join, I think a couple others
are coming. It's a great dive bar, I know all the bartenders."

"Oh I'm *very* familiar with Accordion Club. I love that place! See you there!"



Anticipating my condition I tie my steed up at the hitchin' post at my boarding
house and set of to the saloon on foot. I show up to my new friends Dana, Renay, 
and Matt halfway through their first sarsparilla. I mosey over to a stool and
order up a ___________ pale ale? Over our 

A few rounds of PBRs, a shot of well tequila, and a vodka soda nightcap.


My alarm squawks in the morning and I feel bleary eyed and cranky. I'm about
halfway through preparing my morning coffee when I realize I'm dealing with
the effects of our delightful biannual tradition of time traveling that we have
all allowed to happen in the Year of Our Lord 2023. Hopefully this pot of Little
Waves _________________ puts a little pep in my step.

Just as with the audition it's raining the day of the callback. Back to the steed.

I check my inbox & at 11:22 AM I have a new message. I read the preview and feel
a slight lump in my throat.
**Good Morning, Thank you so much for attending the aud...**.
I tap the email fully expecting to see a big fat **but** right after "audition."
Thank you so much for attending the audition, *but we're going to go with someone
more experienced.*
Thank you so much for attending the audition, *but we've your dancing was not up to par.*
Thank you so much for attending the autition, *but what the hell were you thinking?*

I open the email & I'm relieved to find not a **but** but an invitation to a
callback. The first rehearsal was to start tomorrow but Mark has decided to hold
a callback instead of a rehearsal. I think that's good?


First song Patsy Cline probably listened to the CD hundreds of times. Listened
to Patsy in the old Mercury sedan before Johnny boy came along and we became a
minivan family. I can still
belt out *I Fall To Pieces*, *Crazy*, and *Walkin' After Midnight* in my sleep.
Woody Guthrie - God Bless Texas connection?


NYT page 45 of the June 19, 1978 edition, next to a photo from the South Lawn of
the White House with George Benson no doubt plucking some impossibly smooth
guitar riffs and Dizzy Gillespie leading President Carter in a rendition of
*Salt Peanuts, and above ads for Grease, Jaws 2, and Close 
Encounters of the Third Kind, The Paper of Record reports on the ADF moving from
its former home at Connecticut College, which closes with the line that the
American Dance Festival is "one of the nation's most important institutions."

Why you would like to participate in this process and perform this piece?

Because it’s a way to participate in the ADF that’s so far out of my comfort
zone that the green submit button below is simultaneously terrifying and exhilarating.

Perhaps it's the Oklahoma Catholic upbringing but I have a hard time
I love compliments but hate accepting them.
I feel proud for putting myself out there. I also realize I didn't win the Nobel Prize.
Would I have been as comfortable auditioning for a performance containing nudity
if I were a woman? I can't say for sure. What I can say for sure as someone who
has never performed, let alone performed in the nude, I never fretted over
potential harassment stemming from walking naked in a room full of strangers.
Concerns over the vulnerability that comes with that? Sure. Concerns with the
ambient temperature of the performing space? Absolutely.


<h4 class="article-subheader">It's Like A Drug</h4>
The performance

I exist in the dielectic state of craving praise while simultaneously being
wholly unable to accept it.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Andy, You Shit!</h4>
As rehearsals continue & get more runs under our belt we get more comfortable
with the piece. Less thinking and more emoting.

And then the Saturday before the shows I was feeling really comfortable.

And on the first nude pass I hit Mark with a pec blast.
