<h4 class="article-subheader">"You should do this"</h4>
I open my Instagram to find a message from my wonderful cousin Laura, who I have

with a link entitled **Audition for "This Land Is Your Land" by Mark Haim.**
The was casting call(?) was posted by the American Dance Festival, the Durham
based dance company that hosts a dance festival every summer.

January 30th
Deadline March 6th
-I have over a month, plenty of time

Requirements: headshot, 150 word biography, why you want to do this.

To most people this probably seems like a piece of cake. Knock it out between
walkin' the dogs & fixin' supper. But for a habitual overthinker it wasn't so
easy. I just finished writing 90,000 words about a ski trip,
150 words on a bio is a lexigraphical(?) economy I can only aspire to. Then as
to why I want to participate in this process and perform this piece? Where do I
even begin? And then the headshot makes me feel like Kevin McCallister when he
has to pack his suitcase.

SUBMIT.

A HEADSHOT!?

Woof.

Well at least I have a month to think it all over.
I spent a stupid amount of time getting a headshot. Pizza box.


Left for ski trip Friday evening March 3
Deadline was Monday March 6.



<h4 class="article-subheader">The Performance Contains Nudity</h4>
This line in the audition call intrigued me the most. What exactly does "contains
nudity" mean? Does *contains nudity* fall on a performance nudity scale that I'm
unaware of? Suggests nudity - teases nudity - flashes
nudity - contains nudity - features nudity - showcases nudity - celebrates nudity.



"Once you have watched the video, respond to this email by **tomorrow, March 7**
to confirm that you will be in attendance at the audition.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Audition</h4>
As someone who's never auditioned for anything I have no idea what to expect. I
tried out for baseball when I was 10 but I don't think cranking dingers is gonna
help me today.

What do I wear? I picked a pair of breathable trousers and a plain dark v-neck.
The only wardrobe instruction we received for the audition was a pair of white
soled sneakers, so I opted for the pair of white Asics I wore to officiate
my good friends Brady & Shelby's wedding last summer. Maybe they got some
magic in them yet.

Raining before original audition.

By the third time around I start to kind of get the hang of it. A slight
glimmer of *y'know what? maybe I **can** do this*

Then Mark hits us with the gallops.

The gallop is an easy enough maneuver to execute on its own. A variation on the
skip where you raise your front leg during the little hop instead of bringing
your other leg through. I could gallop up & down the studio no problem. The
thing about the gallop, though, is it switches your feet. Instead of right foot
odds, left foot evens we've entered the unfamiliar and sinister world of left
foot odds, right foot evens. I cringe just thinking about it.

We do a couple up & backs as a group then Mark lines us back up to do it in
unison and my brain enters the infinite spinny wheel.

"Anybody want to go grab a beer?" I say to nobody and everybody all at once.

"Yeah, where were you thinking?" Dana cheerfully replies.

"Hell I don't care."

"Well I'm headed to Accordion Club if you want to join, I think a couple others
are coming. It's a great dive bar, I know all the bartenders."

"Oh I'm *very* familiar with Accordion Club. I love that place! See you there!"



Anticipating my condition I tie my steed up at the hitchin' post at my boarding
house and set of to the saloon on foot. I show up to my new friends Dana, Renay, 
and Matt halfway through their first sarsparilla. I mosey over to a stool and
order up a ___________ pale ale? Over our 

A few rounds of PBRs, a shot of well tequila, and a vodka soda nightcap.


My alarm squawks in the morning and I feel bleary eyed and cranky. I'm about
halfway through preparing my morning coffee when I realize I'm dealing with
the effects of our delightful biannual tradition of time traveling that we have
all allowed to happen in the Year of Our Lord 2023. Hopefully this pot of Little
Waves _________________ puts a little pep in my step.

Just as with the audition it's raining the day of the callback. Back to the steed.

I check my inbox & at 11:22 AM I have a new message. I read the preview and feel
a slight lump in my throat.
**Good Morning, Thank you so much for attending the aud...**.
I tap the email fully expecting to see a big fat **but** right after "audition."
Thank you so much for attending the audition, *but we're going to go with someone
more experienced.*
Thank you so much for attending the audition, *but we've your dancing was not up to par.*
Thank you so much for attending the autition, *but what the hell were you thinking?*

I open the email & I'm relieved to find not a **but** but an invitation to a
callback. The first rehearsal was to start tomorrow but Mark has decided to hold
a callback instead of a rehearsal. I think that's good?


First song Patsy Cline probably listened to the CD hundreds of times. I can still
belt out *I Fall To Pieces*, *Crazy*, and *Walkin' After Midnight* in my sleep.
Woody Guthrie - God Bless Texas connection?

the White House with George Benson no doubt plucking some impossibly smooth
guitar riffs and Dizzy Gillespie leading President Carter in a rendition of
*Salt Peanuts, and above ads for Grease, Jaws 2, and Close 
Encounters of the Third Kind, The Paper of Record reports on the ADF moving from
its former home at Connecticut College, which closes with the line that the
American Dance Festival is "one of the nation's most important institutions."

Why you would like to participate in this process and perform this piece?

Because it’s a way to participate in the ADF that’s so far out of my comfort
zone that the green submit button below is simultaneously terrifying and exhilarating.

Perhaps it's the Oklahoma Catholic upbringing but I have a hard time
I love compliments but hate accepting them.
I feel proud for putting myself out there. I also realize I didn't win the Nobel Prize.
Would I have been as comfortable auditioning for a performance containing nudity
if I were a woman? I can't say for sure. What I can say for sure as someone who
has never performed, let alone performed in the nude, I never fretted over
potential harassment stemming from walking naked in a room full of strangers.
Concerns over the vulnerability that comes with that? Sure. Concerns with the
ambient temperature of the performing space? Absolutely.
