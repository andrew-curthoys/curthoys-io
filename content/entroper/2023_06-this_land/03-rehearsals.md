summary: 

<h4 class="article-subheader">Jetlagged?</h4>
Mark asks with a slight kick to the left foot of my vaguely animated corpse.

I partially peel open an eyelid and muster the strength for a mumbled
"yeah"

"Sorry, but it's time to start rehearsal," Mark coyly remarks behind a Cheshire
cat smile that I am soon to become intimately familiar with over the course of
the next two weeks.

I scrape myself off the floor of the Samuel H. Scripps Studios at the American
Dance Festival, still reeling from
<a href="/traveler/2023_05-scandinavia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 weeks in Scandinavia</a>.
I just got back to Durham last night and worked all day today so my energy
levels are zapped.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Claw to Maxi to Lewiston to Plastic Surgery to
Mona Lisa to Tightrope to... Wait What's Next?</h4>
Most of the time spent during the first few rehearsals are teaching the
individual segments. Each has its own name that Mark has informally conferred as
he developed the piece and each segment has its own flavor. Whether it be a
different costume, step sequence, hand movements, facial expressions, or other


For example, this is what I write in my notebook for the pass called Plastic
Surgery

Start with head cocked to the right - left hand on hip

Right hand to cup

Uncock head

Left hand down

Right hand down

Right hand to hip

Left hand to cup

Head cocked to the left

Pouty pause

As Mark teaches us each individual segment I get the hang of it pretty quickly.
It's when we link all of them together where my head starts to spin. When we
start to link 3 and 4 segments together I realize I'm going to need a notebook
to write all this down. Halfway through the first week I finally capitulate
back to my comfort zone,

"Ok that's it, I'm gonna need to make a spreadsheet."

By the time I finish filling out my spreadsheet I count 24 on-stage passes,
each with a different outfit, prop, step sequence, step direction, posture,
hand movements, or facial expression. Once we start doing full start-to-finish
run throughs at rehearsal I start to print out my sheet and cross out each pass
as I finish & highlight important reminders for my next pass to cement them in
my noodle.

I don't trust myself to go to the grocery store without a list so
there's no way I'm going to be comfortable memorizing all the intricate
choreography for 24 passes. Especially with the added adrenaline that's likely
to come with a live audience. But one pass at a time I can manage. Did I
mention I'm trusting the process?



<h4 class="article-subheader">Andy, You Shit!</h4>
As rehearsals continue & get more runs under our belt we get more comfortable
with the piece. Less thinking and more emoting.

And then the Saturday before the shows I was feeling really comfortable.

During one pass of Lewistons I shot Mark a little wave. *Hey, how ya doin'*.
He gave an eye-rolley smirk and wrote "Andy, you shit!" in his notebook.

And on the first nude pass I hit Mark with a pec blast.

<div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="4754376" data-share-method="host" data-aspect-ratio="1.79856" data-width="100%"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/terry-crews-muscle-chest-pecs-move-gif-4754376">Terry Crews Pecs GIF</a>from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/terry+crews-gifs">Terry Crews GIFs</a></div> <script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>

This resulted in what I have to imagine is a completely novel entry in Marks
notebook, "Andy, you fuck!"

After each run Mark would give us notes while we're gathered around him on the
floor. When Mark read his notes for me on this run I *literally* rolled around
on the floor laughing. A little bit of levity is warranted when doing the same
thing over and over again for hours at a time. As Mark said, "I didn't want
anybody in this piece who took themselves too seriously." Well, brother, you
got what you asked for with Uncle Andy.

That isn't to say we're unprofessional. Each one of us realize we're here
to do a job and to express Mark's creative vision to the best of our ability.
Throughout each rehearsal we are constantly talking among ourselves, comparing
notes, ironing out steps, perfecting hand positions, trying out facial
expressions. It's a remarkably collaborative and supportive environment.

I never felt reticent to ask a stupid question and if Mark or my compatriots
grew weary of my inane inquiries they did a masterful job hiding it. A typical
sample of a conversation we would have during rehearsal,

"Ok so, Cate, you're high claw leaving pink?"

"No I'm halfway."

"Wait... then where should I be?"

"I think you should be fully high claw leaving blue."

"Leaving blue? Ohhh ok, that makes sense, that way I have two laps to neutral
when I get to green"

"Yes, I'll be neutral just as I'm leaving the stage."

"Got it, thanks."


<h4 class="article-subheader">Catharsis</h4>
There's something about being cooped up in the same room with the same people
performing the same movements to the same songs that can play with your emotions
in unexpected ways. During the last rehearsal of our first week Mark introduces
a new section of the performance that's an homage to the Covid pandemic. It's
simple, it's moving, it's beautiful.

After our first *pandemic* runthrough the collective dam holding
everyone's emotional reservoir bursts, releasing a tsunami of
sentimental feelings that leaves nary a dry eye in the studio. Each of us
experiences our own unique, personal emotional journey, which is shared
through the shared language of weepy hugs. For me, it's as simple as remembering
riding in the car with my dad, listening to country music on 95.5 FM. It's such
a simple memory that carries the weight of the memories of a man whose
personality was so enormous everyone called him Big Daddy.

	<figcaption class="figure-caption">I'm just a carefree range-ridin' driftin' cowpoke</figcaption>
</figure>

I wipe way the tears thinking how I just wish I could hear him say, "why the
hell do you want walk around naked in front of a bunch of people."

Because that's exactly what he would say.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Pythagoras</h4>
During our first rehearsal Mark gives us a tip to help keep our lines
straight, "make sure your steps are a little longer on the way back because
you have to walk farther since it's on an angle."

At this point my brain starts calculating. It's a subconscious reaction that I
have no control over.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Ok so we take 8 steps out, and if we assume it's one step over on the way back,
Pythagoras tells us our hypotenuse would be $\sqrt{65}$. That
can't possibly be <b>that</b> much bigger than 8 right?
</div>

At the next break I grab my phone.

$\sqrt{65} = 8.0623$.

Which means the distance we have to walk upstage is 0.778% longer than the
distance we have to walk downstage\*. So if we assume an average stride distance
of 2.5 ft that's a difference of 1.87 inches over a total distance of 20 feet.

\*I just learned what upstage & downstage meant during rehearsal today.

I'm not saying there's a psychological difference in how far it *feels*.

I'm just saying the *actual* distance is pretty negligible. I'm also saying that
I'm a pedantic asshole whose brain doesn't have an off switch.

Which might be why I was able to pick up a dance performance based on
counting and trigonometry so quickly. Perhaps.

I eventually acquired an adequate Sally acumen and my next challenge was to
master the "maxi" skip. So called because we are going to the max&trade;, the
maxi is a mix between a skip and a speed skating lunge. My initial attempts were
akin to a baby giraffe learning to walk, an graceless cyclone of gangly
appendages. If there was ever any evidence that I have no dance experience this
is it.

Mark enlists the expertise of Alexandra for some personal coaching. She does a
few skips with a lithe effortless nonchalance that implies this should be easy.
*See? Just like that.* It's the dancing equivalent of Tiger Woods striping a 2
iron then looking at me, "See? Just like that." Well, Alexandra, I don't even
own a 2 iron.

But I put my faith in the process and continue to work at it. At some point
throughout our two weeks of rehearsal I receive further personal instruction
from Allie, Alyce, Brace, and Hendri. Sometimes at the behest of Mark,
sometimes out of pity. I learn the key is to pivot your foot and swivel your
hips before launching to the other side. Each bit of incremental progress I make
the other dancers smile proudly in the slightly patronizing way you
do for the kid picking dandelions out in right field. *You're doing great,
Andy.*

By the time we finish rehearsals I believe I've dragged my maxi skip into the
realm of *adequate*, and I'll take that.



<h4 class="article-subheader">A-What Now?</h4>
"Ok Linda, you are going to come out during the adagio sequence."

I whisper to Allie, "the what sequence?"

"Adagio"

*blank stare*

"It's a dance term that means..... actually you don't have to do it so don't
worry about it"

Ah what a wonderful phrase. The dancer's hakuna matata.

This is hardly the first or the last time I'm left plumflutterated at the use of
a dance term that I have no idea what it means.

When exhibiting the posture and facial expression Mark is looking for in one
section of the piece he exclaims,

"I feel like Monica Bill Barnes!!"

I lean over to Allie, "who's Monica Bill Barnes?"

She looks at me like I asked who Michael Jordan was at a basketball camp. "She's
a choreographer in New York."

"Ah ok, got it."

So Monica Bill Barnes is a choreographer in New York. But I still have no idea
what Mark meant. I hope my MBB energy came through my performance nonetheless.

"Who is the first one to come out with the straw cup?"

"Right here! Uncle Andy!"

Allie asks, "are you actually an uncle?"

"To my friends' pets I am"



<h4 class="article-subheader">Headshot Redux</h4>

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Greetings Dancers!

I have created a shared doc for you all to type your bios in. The deadline for
bios is June 8th and when you all get the chance, please email me your headshots
along with your first and last name. 
</div>

Oh no, not this again.

At least this time I have the experience of a baker's
dozen dancers that I can lean on. I ask the crew if they will help me write a
bio and take a headshot and they of course agree. We plan to huddle up at the
next rehearsal, where I summarily forget. And continue to forget each of the
next three rehearsals until the deadline day. I hastily scribble something down
and send it to Destinee, I'll have to figure something out for this headshot.

Today is our day off so Dana agrees to meet me at Daily Beer Bar to punch up
my bio & take a headshot for me. Seeing as we're planning to sip some suds from
my favorite beer bar in Durham I throw on a shirt from
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/americansolera/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my favorite brewery</a>.

<figure class="figure container-fluid">

	<figcaption class="figure-caption">Meet Beyonce the brewery cat</figcaption>
</figure>

As I stroll up to the bar Dana sees me and immediately exclaims, "Oh my god,
you're NOT wearing that for your headshot!"

"What?"

"That shirt!"

"What about it?"

"You can't wear that shirt in your headshot!"

"Why does my shirt matter? It's a HEADshot not a HeadAndShirtshot"

The look on Dana's face was a mixture of disappointment, resignation, and a
heavy dose of *you're an idiot*.

So I guess we're not getting a head(and shirt apparently)shot today. I'm
stressing out because it's already past the deadline and we're getting close
to opening day. Dana assures me that the programs are all digital so my worries
about getting the headshot and bio submitted before they "go to the presses"/*
with the programs are unfounded.

/*do they say that? I don't know, you get the idea.

We spend about a beer and a half mulling over the wording of my bio, cutting
this, tightening that, rewording here. Once we're satisfied I send over the
final copy to Desinee and agree to bring a plain, unmarked (boring) shirt to
rehearsals tomorrow for my headshot. We each vow to not forget tomorrow.

And then forget.

Luckily I remember just as I'm walking out the door and Dana is already on her
way home. I commandeer Allie to serve as photographer, who surely would prefer
to do *anything* else after 6 hours of rehearsing. But she agrees because she's
a wonderful human. We make a whirlwind tour of the studios looking for an
appropriate backdrop and lighting. We find a spot in the main rehearsal space
and Allie snaps a series of photos while Brace cracks me up by just being Brace.

An artist is only as good as her tools and despite Allie's best efforts I...
look like a tool. I wouldn't recommend a photoshoot while exhausted and sweaty
from a full day of rehearsing. Whatever, I send the photo and put the whole
headshot hardship behind me.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Andy Meet Aspen, Aspen Meet Zane</h4>
At the start of rehearsals Mark had us write our name on a few of our props for
the performance. Since I routinely wake up in the morning and choose silliness
I wrote A<span class="flip-h">N</span>DY like our best good pal Woody proudly
brandishes on the bottom of his cowboy boot.

And this is how I inadvertently adopted Andy as my stage name.

One day Alexandra asks me, "Do you prefer Andrew or Andy?"

"I don't really care, either works"

Alexandra then gives me a look of someone who's been called "Alex",
"Allie", "Alexandria", and any number of creative or otherwise head-scratching
names that suggests *no seriously, what do you like to be called?*

But I really don't have a preference. I've been called *much* worse than Andy, I
can assure you of that. Among my friends back home I'm almost exclusively
called "Toys". This curious cognomen was a natural evolution of a high school
milieu in which we all called each other by our last names. Curthoys soon became
CarToys, which, in a stroke of ruthless syllabic economy simply became "Toys."
The moniker was passed down like a pair of worn out sneakers to my younger
brothers, who are known by my friends as Allie (Alex) Toy, Timmy Toy, & Johnny
Toy. Naturally, I'm known to all their friends as Andy Toy.

This did have the concomitant effect that during rehearsals, in an effort to
emphasize that the prop guns used during the performance were not real weapons
Mark encouraged us to call them "toys" instead of "guns." So every time someone
referenced the prop guns my head instinctively popped up like a meerkat.

<figure class="figure">

	<figcaption class="figure-caption">Did someone say toys?</figcaption>
</figure>

When discussing what Mark calls our "high fashion" outfits he tells me, "Andy,
I'm thinking you will be a granola, hippie co-op barista type. I'm thinking
Birkenstocks, maybe a chunky sweater, & a sarong. Do you have any of that?"

"Uhhh no." I don't admit that I don't know what a sarong is.

"Ok ask around if you can borrow something. Brace, Hendri, and I are going
shopping on Friday so we'll look for something for you too."

"Okie doke."

When the Seattle crew returns from their Friday shopping spree they have found
me a crop top sweater with a deep V, a high slit sarong, and a colorful over
the shoulder bag. I borrow some Birkenstocks from a friend in my apartment and
add dig up a green scuba diving headband that I stole from my brother who stole
it from my mom. This crunchy character I decide to call "Aspen."

Something about this outfit really causes my Shirley strut to pop.

My final outfit is completely supplied by yours truly. One day while leaving
rehearsals Brace hollers, "hey, bring your cowboy hat tomorrow."

"10-4, should I bring my shitkickers too?"

"Yes."

"You got it partner."

So I show up the next day with a pair of cowboy boots, blue jeans, a pearl snap
shirt from a
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/shinyribs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shinyribs</a> concert in San Antonio, a bolo tie from Montana, and a
cowboy hat I requisitioned at the Houston rodeo.

When I'm adorned in full cowboy regalia Mark looks at me, "oh we need a name for
this cowboy...... I'm going to call you 'Zane'".

The Durham Herald Sun ran a story on Zane the next day

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
A tall handsome stranger rode into town<br>
With fire in his eyes burning red as sundown<br>
His boots were all dusty, his coat open wide<br>
Six ways of dying hung low on his side

<h4 class="article-subheader">About That Whole Nudity Thing</h4>
I'll admit, when I first saw the video of the previous performance with *full
nudity* I felt an initial jolt of anxiety mixed with excitement mixed with
trepidation. The trepidation quickly turned into an immature mirthfulness, where
I was using cosmopolitan terms such as "hang dong" in an attempt to entice my
friends from out of state to come to the performance. My only preparation for
the nudity was a strict diet
and maniacal workout program. Because who would know about vainglorious pursuits
more than a man who built an entire website to write about himself.

But I don't want to breeze over the nudity. Because I'm fully aware that my
standing in society as a man dominates every aspect of how I feel about it. I've
never felt overtly sexualized by another person. I've never been catcalled. I've
never been told I need to *smile more*. I've never felt unsafe walking home at
night. I've never carried pepper spray. I've never felt uncomfortable in a room
full of men. I've never been sexually assaulted.

I've never experienced the innumerable
unfortunate and inexcusable incidents directed at women in our society.

I have no frame of reference to relate to the women who are performing in this
piece. I have no idea of each of their stories. But I have to assume that each
of them has endured unwanted abuses however large or small that weighs on their
decision to perform in this piece.

I'm not brave for walking naked in a room full of people. Renay and McKelynn and
Linda and Alexandra and Cate and Dana and Allie and Carrie and Alyce are. They
may not consider themselves brave but it takes a hell of a lot more courage for
them to step around that curtain than it does for me. And I respect and admire
them for it.

A few times during rehearsal breaks the topic of nudity would get brought up.
Each woman had a different perspective, a different story, a different mindset,
a different journey. And each time this topic was broached, I realized it was
time for me to shut the fuck up and listen and learn. Despite the fact that each
woman had their own story of acceptance and comfort level with the nudity,
almost every conversation ended up with the  to separate nudity from
sexualization. Nearly every woman remarked that they were much more comfortable
accepting the nudity when



I can't speak for the other members of the cast but I was slightly surprised how
quickly the nudity became just another part of the performance. I'm sure it had
something to do with us scrambling to rip off all our clothes as quickly as
possible while remembering our steps for the next pass. But as I stated earlier,
everybody comported themselves in the most professional way possible. The nudity
was always going to be as big or small of a deal as we made it. And we
approached it with a matter-of-fact pragmatism that took the power away from the
dichotomy of clothed vs unclothed.

Going full circle back to
<a href="/entroper/2023_06-this_land/01-you_should_do_this.html?id=red-sparrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Sparrow</a>

When we stripped ourselves of the carapace of modern society we cease to become
Democrats or Republicans, Christians or Jews, citizens or immigrants. We are
simply *humans*. A condition that does not know national borders, does not
know ethnic rivalries, does not know racial tension. The more we strip away the
more we realize how similar we all are.

Am I saying the world would be a better place if we all walked around stark
naked in front of a group of strangers? Maybe. Would it be a worse place? I
doubt it.

Each woman had their own level of comfort, their
own insecurities, their own apprehensions.


I would always sit back and listen.
