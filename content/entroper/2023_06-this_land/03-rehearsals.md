summary: 

*\*Mark always referred to Linda by her full name. The rest of the company
naturally followed suit.*

<h4 class="article-subheader">"Jetlagged?"</h4>
Mark asks with a slight kick to the left foot of my vaguely
animated corpse.

I peel open an eyelid and muster the strength for a mumbled "yeah."

"Sorry, but it's time to start rehearsal," Mark coyly remarks behind a Cheshire
cat smile that I will become intimately familiar with over the course of the
next two weeks.

I scrape myself off the floor, still reeling from
<a href="/traveler/2023_05-scandinavia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 weeks in Scandinavia</a>.
I just flew into Durham late last night and worked all day today so my batteries
are are running on emergency reserve.

During the two months between the audition and the start of rehearsals Mark sent
us an email with our order in the lineup. He assigned each of us a performer from
the Paris video to study. I drew Jurg:

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
9. Andrew (JURG)- orange T shirt, light grey pants. ENTRANCE IS AT 4:24
</div>

When I watch the video I'm struck by a euphoric realization - all the
gallops occur in the first 3 minutes. Since Jurg doesn't come on till 4:24
I won't be doing any gallops! Praise be!!! Based on my complete galloptrical
ineptitude during the audition I'd say Mark's decision to spare me
from gallop duty is wise and prudent.

During the first few rehearsals the majority of our time is spent learning the
choreography of the separate segments that make up the whole of the performance.
Each has its own name that Mark has informally conferred over the years and each
has its own flavor.

<figure class="figure">

</figure>

As Mark teaches us each individual part I get the hang of them relatively quickly.
It's when we start to link 3 or 4 sections together that my head starts to spin.
I quickly follow the lead of the more seasoned dancers and begin to write it all
down in a notebook.

For example, this is what I jot down for the pass called "Plastic
Surgery"

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Start with head cocked to the right, left hand on hip, straw in mouth<br>
1/2 lap to get right hand to cup<br>
1 lap to uncock head<br>
1/2 lap to drop left hand<br>
1/2 lap to drop right hand<br>
1/2 lap to get right hand to hip<br>
1/2 lap to get left hand to cup<br>
1 lap to cock head to the left<br>
1/2 lap to drop right hand<br>
1/2 lap to drop left hand<br>
4 count pouty pause<br>
1/2 lap to get left hand to hip
</div>

And that's just one pass. I have over 20 passes. After just a few
rehearsals the bewildering complexity overwhelms me and I
retreat back to my comfort zone,

"Ok that's it, I'm gonna need to make a spreadsheet."

By the time I finish filling out my spreadsheet I count 24 passes,
each with a different outfit, prop, step sequence, step direction, posture,
hand movement, facial expression, or other some such choreographic flourish.
Once we start full start-to-finish run-throughs I print out my
sheet and cross out each pass as I complete it.

I don't trust myself to go to the grocery store without a list so
there's no way I'm going to be comfortable memorizing intricate
choreography for 24 passes. Especially with the added adrenaline that's likely
to come with a live audience. But one pass at a time I can manage. At least I
hope I can.

</figure>

As rehearsals grind on my Sally eventually reaches a level that could
generously be described as *adequate*. My next challenge is
to master the "maxi" skip. So called because we are going to the max&trade;, the
maxi is a mix between a skip and a speed skating lunge. My initial attempts are
a graceless cyclone of gangly appendages; the dancing equivalent a baby
giraffe learning to walk. If there was ever any evidence that I have no
experience this is it.

<div class="mb-3" style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/85cXrCIHjraRa" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>

Mark, while trying to smother a watching-a-car-wreck-in-slow-motion grimace,
enlists the expertise of Alexandra for some personal coaching. She does a
few skips with a lithe, effortless nonchalance that implies this should be easy.

*See? Just like that.*

It would be like Tiger Woods striping a 2 iron then looking at me,

*See? Just like that.*

Well, Alexandra, I don't even own a 2 iron.

But I put my faith in the process and continue to work at it. At some point
throughout our two weeks of rehearsal I receive further personal instruction
from Allie, Alyce, Brace, and Hendri. Sometimes at the behest of Mark,
sometimes out of pity. I learn the key is to pivot your foot and swivel your
hips before launching to the other side. Each bit of incremental progress I make
the other dancers smile proudly in the slightly patronizing way you
do for the kid picking dandelions out in right field. *You're doing great,
Andy.*

By the time we finish rehearsals I believe I've dragged my maxi skip to a
marginally presentable level. I guess that will have to do.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Pythagoras</h4>
During our first rehearsal Mark gives us a tip to help keep our lines
straight, "make sure your steps are a little longer on the way back because
you have to walk farther since it's on an angle."

At this point my brain starts calculating. It's a subconscious reaction that I
have no control over.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Ok so we take 8 steps out, and if we assume it's one step over on the way back,
Pythagoras tells us our hypotenuse would be $\sqrt{65}$ steps. That
can't possibly be <b>that</b> much bigger than 8 right?
</div>

At the next break I grab my phone.

$\sqrt{65} = 8.0623$.

Which means the distance we would have to walk upstage is 0.778% longer than the
distance we walk downstage\*. If we assume an average stride distance of 2.5 ft
that means we'd walk 20 feet downstage and to account for the angle we'd need
to walk 20 feet 1.87 inches on the way back. Or an extra 0.23 inches per step.
We're good but I don't think we're *that* good.

*\*I just learned what upstage & downstage meant during rehearsal today. I'm only
77.8% sure I'm using it correctly here.*

I'm not saying there's a psychological difference in how far it *feels*.

I'm just saying the *actual* distance is pretty negligible. I'm also saying that
I'm a pedantic asshole whose brain doesn't have an off switch.

But then again that might be why I'm able to pick up a dance performance based
on counting and trigonometry. Perhaps.

	<figcaption class="figure-caption">Of course I made a graph. Pedantic asshole indeed.</figcaption>
</figure>


<h4 class="article-subheader">A-What Now?</h4>
During one of the rehearsals, Mark exhibits the posture and facial expression
he's is looking for and exclaims,

"I feel like Monica Bill Barnes!!"

I lean over to Allie, "who's Monica Bill Barnes?"

She looks at me like I asked who Michael Jordan was at a basketball camp.

"She's a choreographer in New York."

"Ah ok, got it."

So Monica Bill Barnes is a choreographer in New York. I pretend like this answer
sates my curiosity but I still have no idea what Monica Bill Barnes should look
like. I'll just have to resort to my strategy that has gotten me this far: fake
it till you make it.

This is hardly the first or the last time I'm left plumflutterated at the use of
a dance term or reference.

"We need less Lim&oacute;n overcurve"

"Really emphasize the contrapposto"

"Can you do a tandu?"

"The maxi starts with a turnout then slowly evolves until you end up in second position"

"Linda Belans!\* You are going to come out during the adagio sequence."

I whisper to Allie, "the what sequence?"

"Adagio"

*blank stare*

"It's a dance term that means..... actually you don't have to do it so don't
worry about it"

Ahhhh what a wonderful phrase. The dancer's hakuna matata. So I toss "adagio
sequence" into the incinerator of my brain that's combusting on the last ashes
of the gallops.

You might have noticed that I keep accosting Allie with my obtuse queries. That's
because she's drawn the short straw of slotting behind me in the line. Due to
nothing other than geographic proximity I converse mostly with Allie, Cate, and
Renay. Cate & Renay have the slightly less irritating position in front of me;
Cate for the first half of the performance & Renay for the second after we pull
a switcheroo on the audience.

But dear Allie is beside me start to finish. And since she's *behind* me that
means she's facing right at me each time I load another shell of obtuse ordnance
into my half-wit howitzer. But she's perhaps the best suited of all the
performers to deal with my buffoonery,
seeing as Brace described her as "effervescently direct". She's not afraid to
tell me I'm a dumbass and that's whats I appreciates abouts her.

		<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> you Allie</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4 class="article-subheader">Andy Meet Aspen, Aspen Meet Zane</h4>
At the start of rehearsals Mark instructed us to write our name on a few of our
props. Since I routinely wake up in the morning and choose silliness
I write A<span class="flip-h">N</span>DY like our best good pal Woody
sports 'neath his cowboy boot.

<figure class="figure container-fluid">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/entroper/2023_06-this_land/hearsals-andy_cup.jpeg" alt="Andy">
	<figcaption class="figure-caption">There's a snake in my boots!</figcaption>
</figure>

And this is how I inadvertently adopted Andy as my stage name.

One day Alexandra asks me, "Do you prefer Andrew or Andy?"

"I don't really care, either works."

Alexandra vexedly stares at me with a look of someone who's been called "Alex",
"Allie", "Alexandria", and any number of creative or otherwise head-scratching
names that suggests *no seriously, what do you like to be called?*

But I really don't have a preference. I've been called *much* worse than Andy, I
can assure you of that. Among my friends back home I'm almost exclusively
called "Toys". This curious cognomen arose within a high school milieu in which
everyone was referred to by their last name. Curthoys soon became
CarToys, which, in a display of ruthless syllabic economy simply became "Toys."
The moniker was passed down like a pair of worn out sneakers to my younger
brothers, who are known by my friends as Allie (Alex) Toy, Timmy Toy, & Johnny
Toy. Naturally, I'm known to all their friends as Andy Toy.

This did have the concomitant effect that during rehearsals, in an effort to
emphasize that the prop guns used during the performance were not real weapons,
Mark encouraged us to call them "toys" instead of "guns." So every time someone
referenced the prop guns my head instinctively popped up like a meerkat.

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;">

</div>
<figcaption class="figure-caption mb-2">Did someone say toys?</figcaption>

After a few days of rehearsals we started to figure out our costumes.

Everyone is having a great time. Exchanging outfits, trying out looks,
pilfering through the offerings on display at Boutique Alyce, the miniature
emporium of all things fashion set up by Alyce in a corner of the studio. It's
the dance equivalent of a general store selling picks and shovels during the
California gold rush.

My sartorial selection falls near the very end of the dance wardrobe
spectrum, just this side
of "dad clothes." So while everyone is flitting around exchanging outfits and
trying new looks I mostly just mill about and admire everyone else's duds.
Once everyone has showcased their looks for Mark he eyes my Sunday afternoon
golf attire and sarcastically pans,

"Well *Andy's* made my job easy, you haven't even changed!"

"I don't really have anything that fun, what angle were you thinking for me?"

"I'm thinking a granola, hippie co-op barista type. Birkenstocks, maybe a chunky
sweater, sarong? Do you have any of that?"

"Uhhh no."

I don't admit that I don't know what a sarong is.

"Ok ask around if you can borrow something. Brace, Hendri, and I are going
shopping on Friday so we'll look for something for you too."

"Okie doke."

Brace & Hendri are the newcomers to our crew, but old hats when it comes to the
piece. They were part of the original cast and have stepped these
steps dozens of times over the years. They live in Seattle and Mark called on
them to even out the number of men and presumably add a little diversity to my
fellow white guys, Johnathan & Matt. During the first week we often
rehearsed with them as "holes" in the lineup, but increasingly Aaron stepped in
to fill the gaps. Aaron lives in San Antonio (just a few miles from my old house
we later found out) and is working at ADF for the summer. He has also performed
the piece in the past, bringing three experienced performers to help alleviate
the burden from Mark as the sole expert on the piece.

	<figcaption class="figure-caption">Enjoying lunch with Hendri & Brace ahead
	of night 2</figcaption>
</figure>

When the Seattle crew returns from their Friday shopping spree they have found
me a crop top sweater with a deep V, a high slit sarong, and a colorful over
the shoulder bag. I borrow some Birkenstocks from a friend in my apartment and
add dig up a green scuba diving headband that I stole from my brother who stole
it from my mom. This crunchy character I decide to call "Aspen."

Something about this outfit really causes my Shirley strut to pop.

My final outfit is completely supplied by yours truly. One day while leaving
rehearsals Brace hollers, "hey, bring your cowboy hat tomorrow."

"10-4, should I bring my shitkickers too?"

"Yes."

"You got it partner."

So I show up the next day with a pair of cowboy boots, blue jeans, a pearl snap
shirt from a
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/shinyribs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shinyribs</a> concert in San Antonio, a bolo tie from Montana, and a
cowboy hat I requisitioned at the Houston rodeo.

When I'm adorned in full cowboy regalia Mark looks at me, "oh we need a name for
this cowboy...... I'm going to call you 'Zane'".

The Durham Herald Sun ran a story on Zane the next day,

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">

<h4 class="article-subheader">Headshot Redux</h4>
<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Greetings Dancers!

I have created a shared doc for you all to type your bios in. The deadline for
bios is June 8th and when you all get the chance, please email me your headshots
along with your first and last name. 
</div>

Oh no, not this again.

At least this time I have the experience of a baker's
dozen dancers that I can lean on. I ask the crew if they will help me write a
bio and take a headshot and they of course agree. We plan to huddle up at the
next rehearsal, where I summarily forget. And continue to forget each of the
next three rehearsals until the deadline day. I hastily scribble something down
and send it to Destinee, I'll have to figure something out for this headshot.

Today is our day off so Dana agrees to meet me at Daily Beer Bar to punch up
my bio & take a headshot for me. Seeing as we're planning to sip some suds from
my favorite beer bar in Durham I throw on a shirt from
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/americansolera/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my favorite brewery</a>.

<figure class="figure container-fluid">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/entroper/2023_06-this_land/hearsals-cat.jpeg" alt="Beyonce">
	<figcaption class="figure-caption">Meet Beyonce the brewery cat</figcaption>
</figure>

As I stroll up to the bar Dana sees me and immediately exclaims, "Oh my god,
you're NOT wearing that for your headshot!"

"What?"

"That shirt!"

"What about it?"

"You can't wear that shirt in your headshot!"

"Why does my shirt matter? It's a HEADshot not a HeadAndShirtshot"

The look on Dana's face was a mixture of disappointment, resignation, and a
heavy dose of *you're an idiot*.

So I guess we're not getting a head(and shirt apparently)shot today. I'm
stressing out because it's already past the deadline and we're getting close
to opening day. Dana assures me that the programs are all digital so my worries
about getting the headshot and bio submitted before they "go to the presses"\*
with the programs are unfounded.

*\*do they say that? I don't know, you get the idea.*

We spend about a beer and a half mulling over the wording of my bio, cutting
this, tightening that, rewording here. Once we're satisfied I send over the
final copy to Desinee and agree to bring a plain, unmarked (boring) shirt to
rehearsals tomorrow for my headshot. We each vow to not forget tomorrow.

And then forget.

Luckily I remember just as I'm walking out the door and Dana is already on her
way home. I commandeer Allie to serve as photographer, who surely would prefer
to do *anything* else after 6 hours of rehearsing. But she agrees because she's
a wonderful human. We make a whirlwind tour of the studios looking for an
appropriate backdrop and lighting. We find a spot in the main rehearsal space
and Allie snaps a series of photos while Brace cracks me up by just being Brace.

An artist is only as good as her tools and despite Allie's best efforts I...
look like a dweeb. I wouldn't recommend a photoshoot while exhausted and sweaty
from a full day of rehearsing. Whatever, I send the photo and put the whole
headshot hardship behind me.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Slap Your Grandma</h4>
In the 2005 rhapsodic ode to healthy backsides, "Honky Tonk Badonkadonk,"
Trace Adkins croons,

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
And ooh-wee<br>
Shut my mouth<br>
Slap your grandma<br>
</div>

Now the first time that Linda Belans, a proud grandmother, hears the bard of 
Sarepta, Louisiana suggest said matriarchal thwacking her face turns red. 

"SLAP YOUR GRANDMA!!??"

If Trace Adkins had a grandma the caliber of Linda Belans he wouldn't even think
of such a calamatous feat of skullduggery.

was not nonplussed with the suggestion. As you can imagine it became a running
joke during rehearsals. The timing worked out that Mr Adkins's advocation for
familial violence coincided with my stage exit. And who's seat was
right there at the edge of the stage was none other than the incomparable Linda
Belans.

Each time her reaction would fall somewhere between covering her face with her hands and
shooting me a glare so as to suggest *if you know what's best for your health,
young man, you better not even think about it*. I would never, Linda Belans, I
would never.

<figure class="figure">

	<figcaption class="figure-caption">Linda Belans is a treasure</figcaption>
</figure>

A quick detour: I have discovered that the Trace Adkins Wikipedia page is a
stream-of-consciousness minefield, littered with the wreckage of broken body
parts, broken marriages, and broken sequiturs. A few selections:

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
<p>
"A walk-on offensive lineman on the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football team, Adkins
left the team after his freshman season due to a knee injury, without ever
playing in a game. Adkins never graduated. After leaving college, he worked on
an oil rig."
</p>

<p>
"On June 4, 2011, at approximately 3:35 pm, Adkins' home in Brentwood, Tennessee,
burned down. On October 20, 2011, Adkins sang the National Anthem at game 2
of the 2011 World Series in St. Louis."
</p>

<p>
"The album's second single, 'Arlington', generated controversy over its content
(a first-person account of a fictional soldier who was about to be buried in
Arlington National Cemetery). It was followed by 'Honky Tonk Badonkadonk.'"
</p>

<p>
"In 2001, Adkins was injured in a tractor accident and had to cancel touring
temporarily."
</p>

<p>
"He lost the pinky finger on his left hand in an accident using a knife to open a
bucket, and asked doctors to reattach the finger at an angle so that he could
continue to play guitar."
</p>

<p>
"He has also experienced a number of serious injuries as an adult, including
being shot by his second ex-wife Julie Curtis in 1994. The bullet went
through his heart and both lungs. He survived and chose not to press charges.
They got divorced after 3 years."
</p>

<p>
"In March 2014, Trace Adkins and his wife Rhonda filed for divorce, citing
irreconcilable differences. Rhonda dismissed her divorce petition in June 2015.
Despite rumors of reconciliation, Adkins re-filed for divorce less than a month
later."
</p>

<p>
"Adkins recorded a duet with country legend Ronnie Milsap called "My First Ride"
to benefit fire-fighters and police officers in the U.S. and Canada. Then, after
the song's release, the label said 'no' to radio stations playing it with no
explanation given."
</p>
</div>

I'll use that last little tidbit to fling a lasso 'round the horns of the
runaway steer that this story has become. Because the song that precedes
Adkins's in our performance was sung by none other than Ronnie Milsap.
Originally penned by Burt Bacharach, the song *Any Day Now*, opens Milsap's 1982
album *Inside*. In a stark juxtaposition to Adkins's objectifying anthem,
Milsap tenderly sings about that hollow feeling deep down in your gut when you
know your sweetheart is about to break your heart,

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Any day now<br><br>
I will hear you say<br>
Good bye, my love<br>
And you'll be on your way<br>
Then my wild beautiful bird<br>
You will have flown<br><br>
Any day now<br>
I'll be all alone
</div>

Despite the heart wrenching lyrics Milsap's velvety smooth treatment somehow lulls
you into its captivating trance just like the devilish grin of your former flame.
The song falls squarely in the subgenre of Yacht Rock that I just invented
called *Pontoon DockRock*. As anyone who knows how much I love pontoons and yacht
rock will understand the how much I adore this song.

The song has also been covered by the likes of Elvis Presley, Percy Sledge,
Frankie Valli, Luther Vandross, James Brown, and Eddie Kendricks of The
Temptations. You might have heard of them.

The soundtrack also includes favorites from Eric Church, (fellow Oklahoman) Toby
Keith, Martina McBride, and the Indian Outlaw Tim McGraw, among others. We
listen to the soundtrack so many times that it worms its way into our
subconsciousness. Any time I hear one of the songs from the performance my
brain instinctively starts waiting for the fade-in to the next song in the
piece. It's the same affliction I suffer with *Rumours*.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Catharsis</h4>
With the amount of time we're spending together our discourse inevitably
devolves into shallow, silly discussions of nonsense and frivolity.
One such day I wander into a conversation between Matt & Renay 
regarding their preferred hand holding position. After some wrangling
of mitts Matt ends up in front and Renay in back. They each recall holding hands
in the alternate position but for whatever reason this feels right. I reach out
a paw and find that I fit best in front with both of my colleagues. Matt tries
the frontward position and works out a theory of hand holding logistics: taller
person goes in front.

Which makes sense to me because I think I've only assumed the forward station
and can't remember holding the hand of someone taller than me. Which leads us
to the logical conclusion that I'll have to try it with Brace. We present our
theory and Brace reaches down from the heights of his 6'7" frame and
confirms our hypothesis. Taller person goes in front. If not the shorter
person's wrist wrenches forward uncomfortably. Answering the most world's most
pressing questions here at ADF.

But the captivity does not just engender nonsense and frivolity; it can also
play with your emotions in unexpected ways. During the last rehearsal of our
first week Mark introduces
a new section of the performance that's an homage to the Covid pandemic. It's
simple, it's moving, it's beautiful.

After our first *pandemic* run-through the collective dam holding
everyone's emotional reservoir bursts, releasing a tsunami of
sentimental feelings that leaves nary a dry eye in the studio. Each of us
experiences our own unique, personal emotional journey, expressed
through the shared language of weepy hugs. For me, it's as simple as remembering
riding in the car with my dad, listening to country music on 95.5 FM. It's such
a simple memory that carries the weight of the memories of a man whose
personality was so enormous everyone called him Big Daddy.

<figure class="figure">

	<figcaption class="figure-caption">I'm just a carefree range-ridin' driftin' cowpoke</figcaption>
</figure>

I wipe way the tears thinking how I just wish I could hear him say, "why the
hell do you want walk around naked in front of a bunch of people."

Because that's exactly what he would say.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Andy, You Shit!</h4>
As rehearsals continue we get more comfortable with each run under our belt.
Less thinking and more emoting.

On the Saturday before the shows I was feeling really comfortable.

During one pass of Lewistons I shot Mark a little wave. *Hey, how ya doin'*.
He gave an eye-rolley smirk and wrote "Andy, you shit!" in his notebook.

And then on the first nude pass I hit Mark with a pec blast.

This resulted in what I have to imagine is a completely novel entry in Marks
notebook,

"Andy, you fuck!"

When Mark reads his notes after this run I *literally* roll around on the floor
laughing. I reckon a little bit of levity is warranted as we approach 60
hours of rehearsal time. As Mark said, "I didn't want
anybody in this piece who took themselves too seriously." Well, brother, you
got what you asked for with Uncle Andy.

That isn't to say we're unprofessional. Each one of us realize we're here
to do a job and to express Mark's creative vision to the best of our ability.
Throughout the course of each rehearsal we're constantly talking among ourselves,
comparing
notes, ironing out steps, perfecting hand positions, trying out facial
expressions. It's a remarkably collaborative and supportive environment.

I never feel reticent to ask a stupid question; if anyone grows weary of my
inane inquiries they do a masterful job hiding it. A typical
sample of a conversation we would have during rehearsal,

"Ok so, Cate, you're high claw leaving pink?"

"No I'm halfway."

"Wait... then where should I be?"

"I think you should be fully high claw leaving blue."

"Leaving blue? Let me see.... Ohhh ok, that makes sense, that way I have two
laps to neutral when I get to green"

"Yes, I'll be neutral just as I'm leaving the stage."

"Got it, thanks."






<h4 class="article-subheader">How Do You Hold Hands?</h4>
The captivity of rehearsals, in addition to sparking deep, contemplative
discussions of nudity and sexuality, also sparks shallow, silly discussions of
nonsense and frivolity.

One day during a lull I wander into a conversation that Matt & Renay are
having regarding their preferred method of holding hands. After some wrangling
of mitts Matt ends up in front and Renay in back. They each recall holding hands
in the alternate position but for whatever reason this feels right. I reach out
a paw and find that I fit best in front with both of my colleagues. Matt tries
the frontward position and works out a theory of hand holding logistics: taller
person goes in front.

Which makes sense to me because I think I've only assumed the forward station
and can't remember holding the hand of someone taller than me. Which leads us
to the inevitable conclusion that I'll have to try it with Brace.




<h4 class="article-subheader">Seattle Steppers</h4>
In addition to our complement of a dozen North Carolina-based dancers Mark has
arranged to supplement the company with a couple performers from Seattle who
have performed the piece in the past. Since they have performed the piece before
and live 3 timezones away they are only participating in the second week of
rehearsals.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Markisms</h4>
Throughout the course of rehearsals, Mark would sometimes blurt out something
that was so funny, kooky, or poetically nonsensical I had to jot it down. A few
favorites:

*After our lunch break from our first Sunday rehearsal:*

“Mark was tired & he went home. I showed up and I’m a bitch!”

*On the look he wants us to show during our "neutral" passes*

"I want your face to look like you're staring off into a deep blue lake"

*On the look he wants us to have during "plastic surgery"*

"I want your face to have no expression, like an LA socialite whose face is
paralyzed from her last botox injection."

*On the way we need to walk to look relaxed and not stiff*

"I want you to imagine your body is a million tiny little pieces and each piece
moves independent of one another."

*On the character he wanted us to embody during a section of the piece:*

“I want you to be Tuesday from then Addams Family”

“Do you mean Wednesday!?"

"I only shot a gun when I was a kid at sleepaway camp and I was like this is so stupid! So I went and did arts & crafts! Making structures out of popsicle sticks"

And I think my favorite,

"Linda Belans!"

For whatever reason Mark always referred to Linda by her full name, a practice
that was adopted by the rest of the company.




"Who is the first one to come out with the straw cup?"

"Right here! Uncle Andy!"

Allie asks, "are you actually an uncle?"

"To my friends' pets I am"
