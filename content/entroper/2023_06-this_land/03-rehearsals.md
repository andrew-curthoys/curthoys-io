<h4 class="article-subheader">"Jetlagged?"</h4>
Mark asks with a slight kick to the left foot of my vaguely animated corpse.

I peel open an eyelid and muster the strength for a mumbled "yeah."

"Sorry, but it's time to start rehearsal," Mark coyly remarks behind a Cheshire
cat smile, an impish grin with which I'll become intimately familiar over the
next two weeks.

I scrape myself off the floor, still reeling from
<a href="/traveler/2023_05-scandinavia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 weeks in Scandinavia</a>.
My flight landed late last night so my energy levels are dangerously depleted.

This should go well.

In the midst of our peregrinations to and fro Mark offers a tip to keep our lines
straight, "make sure your steps are a little longer on the way back because
you have to walk farther since it's on an angle."

At this point my brain starts calculating. I'm so tired I can barely stand up
but the "*Well....Actually*" center of my brain is running full steam ahead. It's
like the rich part of town during "rolling blackouts." (Can you tell I'm still
bitter about the Houston ice storm of 2021?)

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Ok so we take 8 steps out, and if we assume it's one step over on the way back,
Pythagoras tells us our hypotenuse would be $\sqrt{65}$ steps. That
can't possibly be <b>that</b> much bigger than 8 right?
</div>

At the next break I grab my phone.

$\sqrt{65} = 8.0623$.

Which means the distance we would have to walk upstage is 0.778% longer than the
distance we walk downstage\*. If we assume an average stride length of 2.5 ft
our downstage stroll totals 20 ft. In order to account for the angle that means
we'd need to walk 20 feet 1.87 inches on the way back. Or an extra 0.23 inches
per step.  We're good but I don't think we're *that* good.

*\*I just learned what upstage & downstage meant during rehearsal today. I'm only
77.8% sure I'm using it correctly here.*

I'm not saying there's a psychological difference in how far it *feels*.

I'm just saying the *actual* distance is pretty negligible. I'm also saying that
I'm a pedantic asshole whose brain doesn't have an off switch.

	<figcaption class="figure-caption">Of course I made a graph. Pedantic asshole indeed.</figcaption>
</figure>

But then again that might be why I'm able to understand a dance performance
based on counting and trigonometry. Perhaps.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Install</h4>
During the two months between auditions and the start of rehearsals Mark sent
us an email with our order in the lineup. He assigned each of us a performer from
the Paris video to study. I drew Jurg:

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
9. Andrew (JURG)- orange T shirt, light grey pants. ENTRANCE IS AT 4:24
</div>

As I watch the video I realize the gallops occur very early in the piece.
Gallops come. Gallops go. And when the gallops are said and done the clock reads
just a shade over 3 minutes. Which means we still have a full minute & a half
till we're introduced to our friend in the orange T-shirt & light grey pants. I
keep my eye out for more gallops to break out but an intoxicating wave of relief
washes over me as I realize the horses are in the stables for good. 

No gallops!! Be gone you vile equine ambulation!!

Honestly, based on my complete galloptrical ineptitude during the audition I'd
say Mark's decision to spare me from gallop duty is wise and prudent.

{{ m.divider() }}

Our first few rehearsals are spent learning the choreography of the
individual segments that make up the whole of the performance. Like we learned
in the audition, each has its own name that Mark has informally conferred over
the years and each
has its own flavor. *The Claw* is centered around hand movements. *Mona Lisa*
emphasizes our facial expression. Our old friends *Sally* and *Lewiston*
express themselves through their gait.

<figure class="figure">

	<figcaption class="figure-caption">The gang gets notes</figcaption>
</figure>

As Mark works through the parts I get the hang of them *individually*. 
When he starts to link 2 and 3 segments together is where
my head starts to spin. I quickly follow the lead of the more seasoned dancers
and begin to write it all down in a notebook.

For example, this is what I jot down for *Plastic Surgery*

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Start with head cocked to the right, left hand on hip, straw in mouth<br>
1/2 lap to get right hand to cup<br>
1 lap to uncock head<br>
1/2 lap to drop left hand<br>
1/2 lap to drop right hand<br>
1/2 lap to get right hand to hip<br>
1/2 lap to get left hand to cup<br>
1 lap to cock head to the left<br>
1/2 lap to drop right hand<br>
1/2 lap to drop left hand<br>
4 count pouty pause<br>
1/2 lap to get left hand to hip
</div>

And that's just one pass. After just a few rehearsals the bewildering complexity
overwhelms me and I retreat back to my comfort zone,

"Ok that's it, I'm gonna need to make a spreadsheet."

By the time I finish filling out my spreadsheet I count 24 passes,
each with a different outfit, prop, step sequence, step direction, posture,
hand movement, facial expression, or other some such choreographic flourish.
Once we start full start-to-finish run-throughs I print out my
sheet and cross out each pass as I complete it.

<figure class="figure">

	<figcaption class="figure-caption">The evolution of the spreadsheet</figcaption>
</figure>

Many of the other dancers develop "musical cues," which inform them when to
emerge from behind the curtain. With my maniacal devotion to my spreadsheet and
natural affinity for numbers I eschew with musical cues altogether and focus
solely on my count. Everyone has their own system but the important part is that
it works for you. Because we're popping out from behind the curtain blind. Brace,
Hendri, and Aaron lets us know we can *kinda* see through the curtain from
backstage but it's not worth trusting. The first few rehearsals we practiced
with the curtain at waist height so we could see what was going on on-stage. It
was a little nerve-racking when we graduated to the full curtain.

</figure>

As rehearsals grind on my Sally eventually reaches a level that could
generously be described as *adequate*. My next challenge is
to master the "maxi" skip, so called because we are going to the max&trade;. The
maxi is a mix between a skip and a speed skating lunge. My initial attempts are
a graceless cyclone of gangly appendages; the dancing equivalent a baby
giraffe learning to walk. If there was ever any evidence that I have no
experience this is it.

<div class="mb-3" style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/85cXrCIHjraRa" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>

Mark, while trying to smother a *watching-a-car-wreck-in-slow-motion* grimace,
enlists the expertise of Alexandra for some personal coaching. She does a
few skips with a lithe, effortless nonchalance that implies this should be easy.

*See? Just like that.*

It would be like Tiger Woods striping a 2 iron then looking at me,

*See? Just like that.*

Well, Alexandra, I don't even own a 2 iron.

But I put my faith in the process and continue to work at it. At some point
throughout our two weeks of rehearsal I receive further personal instruction
from Allie, Alyce, Brace, and Hendri. Sometimes at the behest of Mark,
sometimes out of pity. I learn the key is to pivot your foot and swivel your
hips before launching to the other side. Each bit of incremental progress I make
the other dancers smile proudly in the slightly patronizing way you
do for the kid picking dandelions out in right field. *You're doing great,
Andy.*

By the time we finish rehearsals I believe I've dragged my maxi skip to a
marginally presentable level. I guess that will have to do.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Do You Prefer Andrew or Andy?</h4>
Once we graduate to props Mark instructs us to write our name on a handful of
cups to keep everything organized. Since I routinely wake up in the morning and
choose silliness I write A<span class="flip-h">N</span>DY like our best good pal
Woody brandishes 'neath his cowboy boot.

<figure class="figure container-fluid">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/entroper/2023_06-this_land/hearsals-andy_cup.jpeg" alt="Andy">
	<figcaption class="figure-caption">Somebody's poisoned the waterhole!</figcaption>
</figure>

And this is how I inadvertently adopt Andy as my stage name.

One day Alexandra asks me, "Do you prefer Andrew or Andy?"

"I don't really care, either works."

Alexandra stares at me with a look of someone who's been called "Alex",
"Allie", "Alexandria", and any number of creative or otherwise head-scratching
names that suggests *no seriously, what do you like to be called?*

But I really don't have a preference. I've been called *much* worse than Andy, I
can assure you of that. Among my friends back home I'm almost exclusively
called "Toys". This curious cognomen arose within a high school milieu where
everyone was known by their last name. Curthoys soon became
CarToys, which, in a display of ruthless syllabic economy simply became "Toys."
The moniker was passed down like a pair of worn out sneakers to my younger
brothers, who are known by my friends as Allie (Alex) Toy, Timmy Toy, & Johnny
Toy. Naturally, I'm known to all their friends as Andy Toy.

This did have the concomitant effect that during rehearsals, in an effort to
emphasize that the prop guns used during the performance were not real weapons,
Mark encouraged us to call them "toys" instead of "guns." So every time someone
referenced the prop guns my head instinctively popped up like a meerkat.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Andy Meet Aspen, Aspen Meet Zane</h4>
After a few days of rehearsals we're tasked with building our costumes. Mark
gave us a few ideas of characters he typically likes to see and outfits that
might work. In advance of costume day everyone rummaged through their closet and
brought a menagerie of clothes, hats, bags, and accessories for consideration.

It shouldn't stretch the imagination that a roomful of dancers let loose on
costumes makes for a gleeful atmosphere. The cast is buzzing, exchanging outfits,
trying out looks, channeling Tim Gunn. The star of costume day is Boutique Alyce,
a miniature emporium of all things fashion set up by Alyce in a corner of the
studio. It's the dance equivalent of a general store selling picks and
shovels during the California gold rush.

<figure class="figure container-fluid">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/entroper/2023_06-this_land/hearsals-alyce.jpg" alt="Alyce">
	<figcaption class="figure-caption">The proprietor herself</figcaption>
</figure>

Unfortunately my sartorial selection falls at the boring end of the
dance wardrobe spectrum, just this side
of "dad clothes." So while everyone is flitting around exchanging outfits and
trying new looks I mostly just mill about and admire their duds.
After all my compatriots showcase their looks for Mark he eyes my
Sunday-afternoon-middle-manager-in-a-suburban-McMansion golf attire and
sarcastically pans,

"Well *Andy's* made my job easy, you haven't even changed!"

"I don't really have anything that fun, what angle were you thinking for me?"

"I'm thinking a granola, hippie co-op barista type. Birkenstocks, maybe a chunky
sweater, sarong? Do you have any of that?"

"Uhhh no."

I don't admit that I don't know what a sarong is.

"Ok ask around if you can borrow something. Brace, Hendri, and I are going
shopping on Friday so we'll look for something for you too."

"Okie doke."

Brace & Hendri, the newcomers to our crew, were part of the original *This Land Is
Your Land* cast and have stepped these steps dozens of times over the years.
They live in Seattle and Mark called on them to even out the number of men and
presumably add a little diversity to my similarly melanin challenged male
participants, Johnathan & Matt.

During the first week we often rehearsed with
Brace & Hendri as "holes" in the lineup, but increasingly Aaron stepped in
to fill the gaps. Aaron is another transplant who hails from San Antonio (just a
few miles from my old house we later find out) working at ADF for the summer.
He has also performed the piece in the past, bringing three experienced
performers to help alleviate the pedagogical burden from Mark.

</figure>

After the Seattle steppers return from their shopping spree I'm provisioned with
a deep-V crop top sweater, a high slit sarong, and a colorful over
the shoulder bag. I borrow some Birkenstocks from a friend in my building and
dig up a green scuba diving headband that I stole from my brother who stole
it from my mom. I decide to call this crunchy character "Aspen."

Something about this outfit really causes my Shirley strut to pop.

My final outfit, a cowboy ensemble, begins to take shape as I'm headed out for
the day. Brace hollers,

"Hey, bring your cowboy hat tomorrow."

"10-4, should I bring my shitkickers too?"

"Yes."

"You got it partner."

So I show up the next day with a pair of cowboy boots, blue jeans, a pearl snap
shirt from a
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/shinyribs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shinyribs</a> concert in San Antonio, a bolo tie from Montana, and a
cowboy hat I requisitioned at the Houston rodeo.

When I'm adorned in full cowboy regalia Mark looks at me, "oh we need a name for
this cowboy...... I'm going to call you 'Zane'".

The Durham Herald Sun ran a story on Zane the next day,

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
A tall handsome stranger rode into town<br>
With fire in his eyes burning red as sundown<br>
His boots were all dusty, his coat open wide<br>
Six ways of dying hung low on his side
</div>


<h4 class="article-subheader">Adagi-what Now?</h4>
"Linda Belans!!\* You are going to come out during the adagio sequence."

\*Mark always referred to Linda by her full name. It became a running gag with
the company.

I whisper to Allie, "the what sequence?"

"Adagio"

*blank stare*

"It's a dance term that means..... actually you don't have to do it so don't
worry about it"

Ahhhh what a wonderful phrase! The dancer's hakuna matata. 

This is hardly the first or the last time I'm left plumflutterated at the use of
a dance term or reference.

"We need less Lim&oacute;n overcurve"

"Really emphasize the contrapposto"

"Just imagine you're doing a tandu"

"The maxi starts with a turnout then slowly evolves until you end up in second
position"

"I feel like Monica Bill Barnes!! During this sequence I want everyone to
pretend they are Monica Bill Barnes!!"

Once again I lean over to Allie, "who?"

"Monica Bill Barnes"

"Who's Monica Bilbarns?"

She looks at me like I asked who Michael Jordan was at a basketball camp.

"She's a choreographer in New York."

Choreographer in New York. Got it. That should narrow it down. I pretend like
the answer sates my curiosity but I really have no idea what Monica Bill Barnes
should look like. Guess I'll just have to resort to my strategy that has gotten
me this far: fake it till you make it.

Monica, if you're reading this can you send me a headshot? I need to see how
accurate my impersonation was.

Speaking of headshots...


<h4 class="article-subheader">Headshot Redux</h4>
<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Greetings Dancers!<br><br>

I have created a shared doc for you all to type your bios in. The deadline for
bios is June 8th and when you all get the chance, please email me your headshots
along with your first and last name. 
</div>

Oh no, not this again. Headshots??? Is it too late to back out?

At least this time I have the experience of a baker's
dozen dancers that I can lean on. I ask the crew if they will help me write a
bio and take a headshot and they of course agree. We plan to huddle up at the
next rehearsal, where I summarily forget. And continue to forget each of the
next three rehearsals until the deadline day. I hastily scribble something down
and send it to Destinee. Headshot still pending.

At the end of week 1 we're afforded an off-day, so Dana agrees to meet me at
<a href="http://www.thedailybeerbar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Daily Beer Bar</a> to punch up
my bio & snap a headshot. Seeing as we're planning to sip some suds from
my favorite beer bar in Durham I throw on a shirt from
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/americansolera/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my favorite brewery</a>.

<figure class="figure container-fluid">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/entroper/2023_06-this_land/hearsals-cat.jpeg" alt="Beyonce">
	<figcaption class="figure-caption">Meet Beyonce the brewery cat</figcaption>
</figure>

As I stroll up to the bar Dana sees me and shouts across the street, "Oh my god,
you're NOT wearing that for your headshot!"

"What?"

"That shirt!"

"What about it?"

"You can't wear that shirt in your headshot!"

"Why does my shirt matter? It's a HEADshot not a HEADANDSHIRTshot"

The look on Dana's face is a mixture of disappointment, resignation, and a
heavy dose of *you're an idiot*.

So I guess we're not getting a head(and shirt apparently)shot today. I'm
stressing out because it's already past the deadline and we're getting close
to opening night. Dana assures me that the programs are all digital so my worries
about getting the headshot and bio submitted before "it goes to print" are unfounded.

Seeing as we're already here we spend about a beer and a half mulling over the
wording of my bio, cutting
this, tightening that, rewording here. Once we're satisfied I send over the
final copy to Desinee and agree to bring a plain, unmarked (boring) shirt to
rehearsals tomorrow for my headshot. We each vow to not forget tomorrow.

And then forget.

Luckily I remember just as I'm walking out the door and Dana is already on her
way home. I commandeer Allie to serve as photographer, who surely would prefer
to do *anything* else after 6 hours of rehearsing. But she agrees because she's
a wonderful human. We make a whirlwind tour of the studios looking for an
appropriate backdrop and lighting. We find a spot in the main rehearsal space
and Allie snaps a series of photos while Brace cracks me up by... just being Brace.

An artist is only as good as her tools and despite Allie's best efforts I still
look like a dweeb. I wouldn't recommend a photoshoot while exhausted and sweaty
from a full day of rehearsing. Whatever, I send the photo and put the whole
headshot hardship behind me.

</figure>


<h4 class="article-subheader">You Won't Be My Neighbor?</h4>
It's no coincidence that Allie is preferentially assaulted with my questions of
questionable quality -
she's drawn the short straw of slotting behind me in the line. Due to
nothing other than geographic proximity I converse mostly with Allie, Cate, and
Renay. Cate & Renay have the slightly less irritating position in front of me;
Cate for the first half of the performance & Renay for the second after we pull
a switcheroo on the audience.

But dear Allie is beside me start to finish. And since she's *behind* me that
means she's facing right at me each time I load another shell of obtuse ordnance
into my half-wit howitzer. But she's perhaps the best suited of all the
performers to deal with my buffoonery,
seeing as Brace described her as "effervescently direct." She's not afraid to
tell me I'm a dumbass and that's whats I appreciates abouts her.

<figure class="figure d-table mx-auto">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/entroper/2023_06-this_land/hearsals-squirrely_dan.gif" alt="Squirrely Dan">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption" style="display:table-caption;caption-side:bottom;">
		<span style="color:red">&hearts;</span> you Allie</figcaption>
</figure>

While Allie endures a disproportionate share of my neophytic interrogation she's
not the sole recipient. After one particularly shambolic rehearsal
I exasperatedly look at Dana,

"Is it normal to feel like you've got it one day then feel like you don't know a
damn thing the next?"

"Of course, it happens every time. Rehearsals are like a roller coaster and
everyone is on a different part of the ride. Then somehow it all just clicks."

"Alright I'll take your word for it. Right now it feels like I could do 1000
rehearsals and it wouldn't click."

"You'll be fine."

This is a common theme during rehearsals. Unconditional support and reassurance
are seemingly inexhaustible resources at the Samuel H. Scripps Studios. I never
feel reticent to ask a stupid question, I never feel ostracized for being the
token non-dancer. This wonderful environment is a natural outgrowth from sharing
the studio with the kindest, warmest, most generous people I have ever met.
Every single one of my co-performers has a heart of gold and I would give them
the shirt off my back
(assuming I'm wearing a shirt and not, y'know, fully nude).

<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/entroper/2023_06-this_land/hearsals-gang.jpg" alt="The gang">

	Carrie, Jonathan, Allie, some Jesus lookin' fella, Brace, Hendri, Alyce, Cate,
	Alexandra, & Renay with Mark in the middle of the dancer donut.</figcaption>
</figure>

This supportive environment is championed by Mark, who exudes positivity and
respect. Negativity has no business in a room with Mark Haim. Even when critique
is warranted it's always given with a smile. I ask the other dancers if this is
normal from their experience and they relay that while asshole is not the norm,
they have worked with plenty of assholes. But to a person they say this is the
most fun they've had at a rehearsal.

Fun, but professional. We all realize we're here to do a job expressing Mark's
creative vision to the best of our ability. We respect him and the feeling is
mutual. He affords us plenty of leeway to goof off (which we do in spades) but
we also take it upon ourselves to continuously improve. Throughout the course of
each rehearsal we're constantly talking among ourselves, comparing
notes, ironing out steps, perfecting hand positions, trying out facial
expressions. It's a delightfully collaborative and supportive environment.

A typical sample of a conversation during rehearsal,

"Ok so, Cate, you're high claw leaving pink?"

"No I'm halfway."

"Wait... then where should I be?"

"I think you should be fully high claw leaving blue."

"Leaving blue? Really? I thought it was... Well, let me see.... Ohhhhh *leaving
blue*!... Ok now that makes sense, that way I have two laps to neutral when I
get to green"

"Yes, I'll be neutral just as I'm leaving the stage."

"Got it, thanks."


<h4 class="article-subheader">Toys</h4>
Halfway through week 2 and just a few days before opening night Mark shows up to
rehearsal wearing a look of exasperation.

"I just got off the phone and we have an issue. I don't know where the decision
came from but as of now we're banned from using the prop guns."

"So what are we going to do?"

"I don't know, I've been on the phone with 10 different people this morning and
feel like I'm going to tear my hair out. Let's just start rehearsal & we can
figure it out later."

So we decamp from our seated positions 'round an arsenal of plastic <s>guns</s>
toys that feels like it should be stacked on a powdery mountain of
Colombian marching orders.
The next day Mark reports that (whoever is in charge) suggested Nerf guns
instead of our current lifelike facsimiles. But Nerf guns would make it seem
like we were making light of the situation.

Because whatever you think of the situation the facts are that there are an
estimated 400 million guns in the United States. 20 million of which are assault
style weapons, or one for every inhabitant of Australia. When it comes to
firearms America is the exception. Whether that's exceptionally admirable or
exceptionally abominable depends on your definition of a well trained militia.

The most frustrating part of this whole ordeal is the late notice. Why are
they're springing this on us now? They
can't say they didn't know, this has been in the works for nearly a year. And
Mark has previously staged *this exact same piece in this exact same venue*.

Eventually, after what must have been a thousand phone calls, Mark has secured
a compromise. We will use our current armory of props but will paint them
orange. As an enthusiast of Oklahoma Crimson & Cornell Big Red, I must say
orange is not my favorite color.

But when we see the finished product I'm actually surprised with the result.
The shade of orange actually makes the guns look more menacing than cartoonish.
It's a reasonable compromise that I feel doesn't cheapen Mark's vision. It's not
perfect but all things considered it's better than many of the worse alternatives.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Slap Your Grandma</h4>
In the 2005 rhapsodic ode to healthy backsides, "Honky Tonk Badonkadonk,"
Trace Adkins croons,

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Got it goin' on<br>
Like Donkey Kong<br>
And ooh-wee<br>
Shut my mouth<br>
Slap your grandma<br>
</div>

Poetry. Simple as that.

So the first time that Linda Belans, a proud grandmother, hears the bard of 
Sarepta, Louisiana suggest such a brutish act of matriarchal thwacking her face
turns red. 

"SLAP YOUR GRANDMA!!?? Who does this guy think he is??"

"You don't know Trace Adkins, Linda?"

"No and I don't care to"

"You're really missing out, he has an entire catalog of other songs he didn't
write"

For example: *Songs About Me*, written by Shayne Smith and Ed Hill.

The timing works out with our ambulatory pattern that Mr. Adkins's advocation
for familial violence occurs just as I exit the stage. And whose chair is
perched right at the edge of the curtain?

The incomparable Linda Belans.

Each time I pass by I shoot her a Ralph Kramden "*why I oughta*" look. Her
reaction always falls somewher between "*ahhh shaddup*" and "*if you
know what's best for your health, young man, you better not even think about
it*".

I would never, Linda Belans! I would never!

</figure>

But Trace Adkins may not be deterred from slappin' your grandma because
it seems he cares little for his health. A perusal of his Wikipedia page
reveals a stream-of-consciousness masterpiece, littered with the wreckage of
broken body parts, broken marriages, and broken sequiturs.

From the "*we'll have everybody write their own sentence*" department:

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
<p>
"A walk-on offensive lineman on the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football team, Adkins
left the team after his freshman season due to a knee injury, without ever
playing in a game. Adkins never graduated. After leaving college, he worked on
an oil rig."
</p>

<p>
"On June 4, 2011, at approximately 3:35 pm, Adkins' home in Brentwood, Tennessee,
burned down. On October 20, 2011, Adkins sang the National Anthem at game 2
of the 2011 World Series in St. Louis."
</p>

<p>
"The album's second single, 'Arlington', generated controversy over its content
(a first-person account of a fictional soldier who was about to be buried in
Arlington National Cemetery). It was followed by 'Honky Tonk Badonkadonk.'"
</p>
</div>

The "*my body my corpse*" corps:

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
<p>
"In 2001, Adkins was injured in a tractor accident and had to cancel touring
temporarily."
</p>

<p>
"He lost the pinky finger on his left hand in an accident using a knife to open a
bucket, and asked doctors to reattach the finger at an angle so that he could
continue to play guitar."
</p>
</div>

And of course the "<i>how many crazy ex-wives does it take to realize maybe
<b>you're</b> the problem</i>" squadron:

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
<p>
"He has also experienced a number of serious injuries as an adult, including
being shot by his second ex-wife Julie Curtis in 1994. The bullet went
through his heart and both lungs. He survived and chose not to press charges.
They got divorced after 3 years."
</p>

<p>
"In March 2014, Trace Adkins and his wife Rhonda filed for divorce, citing
irreconcilable differences. Rhonda dismissed her divorce petition in June 2015.
Despite rumors of reconciliation, Adkins re-filed for divorce less than a month
later."
</p>
</div>

And finally, from the ministry of "*how can we shoehorn this back into my story*":

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
<p>
"Adkins recorded a duet with country legend Ronnie Milsap called "My First Ride"
to benefit fire-fighters and police officers in the U.S. and Canada. Then, after
the song's release, the label said 'no' to radio stations playing it with no
explanation given."
</p>
</div>

This final nonsense narrative ties back into the story at hand because`
the song that precedes *Honky Tonk Badonkadonk* in our performance was sung by
none other than... Ronnie Milsap. *Any Day Now*, The opener to Milsap's 1982
album *Inside*, is a stark juxtaposition to Adkins's objectifying anthem. It's a
song that pokes at the raw nerve deep in your gut that shows up during one of
the most painful aspects of the human experience. The feeling that looms over
the dying stages of a relationship as you cling the idea of what once was.

But you know. You tell yourself everything is ok. But you know. Any day now the
hammer will drop and shatter your heart into a million pieces.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Any day now<br><br>
I will hear you say<br>
Good bye, my love<br>
And you'll be on your way<br>
Then my wild beautiful bird<br>
You will have flown<br><br>
Any day now<br>
I'll be all alone
</div>

<iframe class="mb-2" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/30upl1YT1suEgSDpIopSky?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

Somehow Milsap's velvety smooth treatment lulls you into its captivating trance -
just like the devilish grin of your soon-to-be-former lover. If you're not
paying attention you just might miss the heart-wrenching lyrics. I certainly did the
first few times I heard it. It's a song I've decided to categorize, at the
behest of no one, into a subgenre of Yacht Rock I just invented called
*Pontoon DockRock*. As anyone who knows my dual obsession with pontoons and
yacht rock will understand my infatuation with this song.

Ol' Ronnie's version is actually a cover, the original penned by Burt Bacharach,
whose organ-heavy arrangement sounds like something you'd hear at a
non-denominational Sunday service in the 70s. It's a song with no shortage of
cover versions, having been recorded by the likes of Elvis Presley, Percy
Sledge, Frankie Valli, Luther Vandross, James Brown, and Eddie Kendricks of The
Temptations. Pretty insane company for a song I had never heard before two weeks
ago.

Joining Ronnie on our performance soundtrack are favorites from Eric Church, fellow Okie Toby
Keith, Martina McBride, and the Indian Outlaw hisself Tim McGraw. We listen to
the same songs over and over and over and over and over - so many times they
worm their way into our subconsciousness. Any time I hear one of these ditties my
brain instinctively starts waiting for the fade-in to the next song. A life-long
gift that will forever remind me of two of the most fun weeks of my life.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Catharsis</h4>
With the amount of time we're spending together our discourse inevitably
devolves into shallow, silly discussions of nonsense and frivolity.
I stumble into one such discussion between Matt & Renay 
regarding their preferred hand holding position. After some wrangling
of mitts Matt ends up in front and Renay in back. They each recall holding hands
in the alternate position but for whatever reason this feels right. I reach out
a paw and find that I fit best in front with both of my colleagues. Matt tries
the frontward position and works out a theory of hand holding logistics: taller
person goes in front.

Which makes sense to me because I think I've only assumed the forward station
and can't remember holding the hand of someone taller than me. But remembering
isn't science. And we're here for rigorous, fact-based science.

"Brace!"

"Yeah?"

"Come hold my hand"

*pregnant pause and a pursed lips stare that if you know Brace you know*

"I don't know what y'all are doing but *fine*"

And Brace reaches down from the heights of his 6'7" frame and confirms our
hypothesis (*p < 0.001*). Taller person goes in front. If not the shorter
person's wrist wrenches forward uncomfortably. We're answering the most world's
most pressing questions here at ADF.

But the captivity does not *just* engender nonsense and frivolity; it can also
play with your emotions in unexpected ways. During the last rehearsal of week 1
Mark introduces a brand new section of the performance as an homage to the Covid
pandemic. It's simple, it's moving, it's beautiful.

After our first *pandemic* run-through the collective dam holding
everyone's emotional reservoir bursts, releasing a tsunami of
sentimental feelings that leaves nary a dry eye in the studio. Each of us
experiences our own unique, personal emotional journey, expressed
through the shared language of weepy hugs. For me, it's as simple as remembering
riding in the car with my old man, listening to country music on 95.5 FM. It's
such a simple memory that carries the weight of memories of a man whose
personality was so enormous everyone called him Big Daddy.

	<figcaption class="figure-caption">I'm just a carefree range-ridin' driftin' cowpoke</figcaption>
</figure>

I wipe away the tears thinking how I just wish I could hear him say,
"why the hell do you want walk around naked in front of a bunch of people."

Because that's exactly what he would say.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Andy, You Shit!</h4>
As rehearsals continue we get more comfortable with each run.
Less thinking and more emoting.

On the Saturday before the shows I'm feeling really comfortable.

During one pass of Lewistons I shoot Mark a little wave. *Hey, how ya doin'*.
He gives an eye-rolley smirk and writes "Andy, you shit!" in his notebook.

And then on the first nude pass I hit Mark with a pec blast.

<div class="tenor-gif-embed mb-3" data-postid="4754376" data-share-method="host" data-aspect-ratio="1.79856" data-width="100%"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/terry-crews-muscle-chest-pecs-move-gif-4754376">Terry Crews Pecs GIF</a>from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/terry+crews-gifs">Terry Crews GIFs</a></div> <script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>

This results in what I have to imagine is a completely novel entry in Marks
notebook,

"Andy, you fuck!"

When Mark reads his notes after this run I *literally* roll around on the floor
laughing. I suppose a little bit of levity is warranted as we approach 60
hours of rehearsal time. As Mark said, "I didn't want
anybody in this piece who took themselves too seriously."

Well, brother, you got what you asked for here.

Mark returns the favor on our last run-through of rehearsals - as we emerge for
our curtain call we see fearless leader in the back corner of the studio stark
naked doing a ho-down. I mean he's really getting into it, feet flying, arms
flailing,
junk flapping. I just wish I could have seen the reaction of the runners on the
East Campus trail across the street when they saw Mark Haim's bare ass bouncing
in the window.

We've reached the naked goofin' part of rehearsals. That surely means we're
ready for the real thing.

Now, there's only one way to find out.
