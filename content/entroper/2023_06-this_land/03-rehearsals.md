Mark asks with a slight kick to the left foot of my vaguely animated corpse.

I partially peel open an eyelid and muster the strength for a single syllable,
"yeah"

"Sorry, but it's time to start rehearsal," Mark coyly remarks behind a Cheshire
cat smile that I am soon to become intimately familiar with over the course of
the next two weeks.

I scrape myself off the floor of the __________ studio at the American Dance
Festival, still reeling from

As rehearsals continue & get more runs under our belt we get more comfortable
with the piece. Less thinking and more emoting.

And then the Saturday before the shows I was feeling really comfortable.

And on the first nude pass I hit Mark with a pec blast.

Rehaersal


Everyone got emotional

Whatever it was everyone had their ow emotion that they were going through.
All it was for me was just thinking about listening to FM 95.5 with my old man
in Tulsa


"Make sure to make your steps a little longer on the way back because you have
to walk farther since it's on an angle"

At this point my brain starts calculating. It's a subconscious reaction that I
have no control over.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Ok so we take 8 steps out, and if we assume it's one step over on the way back,
Pythagoras tells us our hypotenuse would be $\sqrt{65}$. That
can't possibly be <b>that</b> much bigger than 8 right?
</div>

At the next break I grab my phone.

$\sqrt{65} = 8.0623$.

Which means the distance we have to walk upstage is 0.778% longer than the
distance we have to walk downstage. Or if we assume an average stride distance
of 2.5 ft, a difference of 1.87 inches over a total distance of 20 feet.

I'm not saying there's a psychological difference in how far it *feels*.

I'm just saying I'm a pedantic asshole whose brain doesn't have an off switch.

Which might be why I was able to pick up a dance performance based on
counting and trigonometry so quickly. Perhaps.
