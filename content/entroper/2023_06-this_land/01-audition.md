summary: 

<h4 class="article-subheader">"You should do this"</h4>
I open Instagram to find a message from my wonderful cousin Laura, 5 days
older and 5 times more mature than I. I have
<a href="/rambler/2021_11-nyc_marathon/marathon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">written</a>
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/06-seattle.html?id=laura" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about</a>
<a href="/rambler/2021_11-nyc_marathon/marathon.html?id=ballet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura</a>
before and the amount of pixelated ink I have spilled of our adventures cannot
begin to describe the joy she brings to this world.

This particular missive
contains a link entitled *Audition for "This Land Is Your Land" by Mark Haim.*

Hmmm... that's interesting.

The link leads me to a post from the Durham-based American Dance Festival,
detailing an open audition for a performance in this year's program.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
In honor of the ADF’s decade of collaborating with the Nasher Museum of Art, it
is bringing back a community favorite from 2013: Mark Haim’s “This Land Is Your
Land,” an evening-long dance based entirely on walking.
</div>

Well we're off to a good start, I know how to walk, hell I do it every day. Plus,
as an Oklahoman, I am intimately familiar with Woodrow Wilson Guthrie and his
jaunty sardonic folk ballad that every schoolkid in America knows by heart.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Mark Haim would like to restage the dance for a group of 14 performers from the
NC community and is looking for a very diverse group in age, race, size and gender. 
</div>

Well.... it was fun while it lasted.

You can call a mid-30s straight white guy any number of things but *diverse* is
probably the last word you'd consider.

But since *misplaced confidence* is a descriptor that I think we can use as a
blanket term for all mid-30s straight white guys, I decide to apply anyway.

My response to Laura was 7 short words that began fueling the liquid rocket
booster set to launch me out of my comfort zone into another galaxy.

On the off-chance they have an open square for a mid-30s white guy on their
diversity bingo board I decide to apply anyway.


January 30th
Deadline March 6th
-I have over a month, plenty of time

Requirements:

* 150 word biography.
* A short description why you want to partake in this performance.
* Headshot.

To most people this probably seems like a piece of cake. Knock it out between
walkin' the dogs & fixin' supper. But for a habitual overthinker it ain't so
easy. I just finished writing 90,000 words about a ski trip, so a
150 word bio is a linguistical economy I can only aspire to. Then as
to why I want to participate in this process and perform this piece? Where do I
even begin? And then the headshot makes me feel like Kevin McCallister when he
has to pack his suitcase.

SUBMIT.

A HEADSHOT!?

Woof.

Well at least I have a month to think it all over.

So I spend the month *thinking* and not a minute of *doing*.

As the March 6 deadline looms ever more sinister with each passing day I realize
my window to snag a headshot before I leave for my Utah ski trip on March 3rd is
rapidly closing. While working from home before my evening flight I spend my
entire lunch break struggling to snap an adequate headshot.

It started with a simple "headshot examples" google image search. A panoply of
aggressively beautiful people suddenly appear on my phone screen. Ok so all I
have to do is look natural and find a nice set of high cheekbones and chiseled
jaw in my size. I have a great exposed brick wall and a skylight so the lighting
should be

The most jarring thing of the entire experience was the amount of grease my
forehead can generate in a single morning of staring at a computer screen.

So the light is too bright. I need some sort of shade. So I take a quick
inventory and find the perfect technological implement for my situation.

A used pizza box.



I spent a stupid amount of time getting a headshot. Pizza box.


Left for ski trip Friday evening March 3
Deadline was Monday March 6.



<h4 class="article-subheader">The Performance Contains Nudity</h4>
This line in the audition call intrigued me the most. As a complete outsider to
the world of dance I couldn't help but ponder, "what exactly does 'contains
nudity' mean?" Does *contains nudity* fall on a performance nudity scale that
I'm unaware of?

Suggests nudity  
&emsp;Teases nudity  
&emsp;&emsp;Flashes nudity  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Exposes nudity  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Contains nudity  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Features nudity  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Showcases nudity  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Celebrates nudity  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Overdoes nudity

The Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition, *Volume III: Cham-Creeky*, lists
no fewer than 17 definitions for the word "contains." The most pertinent for our
purposes are probably:

2. a: To have as part (or the whole) of its contents or substance; to comprise,
include.

b: Of a material body or substance: To have in it (as a constituent element or
in combination)

3.

	a. To include, comprise, extend over, measure.

but then we also have definitions 

11.
	a. To restrain, hold in, keep in check; to hold back, keep back, hinder.
	b. To restrain, put restraint on, repress
12. To restrict, limit, confine.

What does *contains nudity* mean?

What does contains nudity *mean*?

"Once you have watched the video, respond to this email by **tomorrow, March 7**
to confirm that you will be in attendance at the audition.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Audition</h4>
As someone who's never auditioned for anything I have no idea what to expect. I
tried out for baseball when I was 10 but I don't think cranking dingers is gonna
help me today.

What do I wear? I picked a pair of breathable trousers and a plain dark v-neck.
The only wardrobe instruction we received for the audition was a pair of white
soled sneakers, so I opted for the pair of white Asics I wore to officiate
my good friends Brady & Shelby's wedding last summer. Maybe they got some
magic in them yet.

Raining before original audition.

I arrive at 5:40 and check in with Kelsey, who hands me number 170 to pin to my
shirt. Which can only mean one thing: I'm going to be the dancing equivalent of
Josh Allen at this audition, only 10 times better. They snap a quick picture,
ostensibly to get a photo with my number, but most likely because my headshot was
so amateurish.

I drop my bag on a bench in the reception area and tentatively stroll into the
studio. A dozen or so people are scattered around the studio in various states
of stretching and mild calisthenics. I find a vacant patch of studio real estate
and do as the Romans do. My stretches would be considered by even the most
generous of observers as *half assed*. Have I mentioned I don't know what I'm
doing?

1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 pivot
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 pivot
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 pivot
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 pivot
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 pivot

right-left-right-left-right-left-right-left pivot
right-left-right-left-right-left-right-left pivot
right-left-right-left-right-left-right-left pivot
right-left-right-left-right-left-right-left pivot

right-foot odds, left foot evens
right-foot odds, left foot evens
right-foot odds, left foot evens

By the third time around I start to kind of get the hang of it. A slight
glimmer of *y'know what? maybe I **can** do this*

Then Mark hits us with the gallops.

The gallop is an easy enough maneuver to execute on its own. A variation on the
skip where you raise your front leg during the little hop instead of bringing
your other leg through. I could gallop up & down the studio no problem. The
thing about the gallop, though, is it switches your feet. Instead of right foot
odds, left foot evens we've entered the unfamiliar and sinister world of
left-foot odds, right-foot evens. I cringe just thinking about it.

What's more, my cozy world of RFO-LFE is further upended by the fact that
switching feet means we switch the direction of our pivot.

**But** only on the laps with odd numbers of gallops.

I stand no chance.

We do a couple up & backs as a group then Mark lines us back up to do it in
unison. I take one step and my brain freezes. I hop, I lurch, I trundle. But I
sure as hell don't gallop. The once steady count in my head viciously sublimates,
forever lost to the steady, growing entropy of the universe. My grasp on the
very concept of numbers has become unsettlingly tenuous.

After a few rounds of gallops I glance over at the woman who is galloping with
the ease of Secretariat, my eyes as wide as saucers,

"I have NO idea what I'm doing."

"You're doing pretty good!" lied Renay.

"I've never auditioned for anything before so all this is completely new to me"

"

We work through a handful of other maneuvers(?): the Sally - a jaunty, carefree
frolic of a strut that's so fun to do you can't help but smile. The Lewiston -
a stiff, __________ gait that reminds me of a wrestling coach.

Mark colors each character with a story of an interaction with that individual
or an archetype of the character. With each story I know exactly the person he's
describing.


"Anybody want to go grab a beer?" I say to nobody and everybody all at once.

"Yeah, where were you thinking?" Dana cheerfully replies.

"Hell I don't care."

"Well I'm headed to Accordion Club if you want to join, I think a couple others
are coming. It's a great dive bar, I know all the bartenders."

"Oh I'm *very* familiar with Accordion Club. I love that place! See you there!"



Anticipating my condition I tie my steed up at the hitchin' post at my boarding
house and set of to the saloon on foot. I show up to my new friends Dana, Renay, 
and Matt halfway through their first sarsparilla. I mosey over to a stool and
order up a ___________ pale ale? Over our 

A few rounds of PBRs, a shot of well tequila, and a vodka soda nightcap.


My alarm squawks in the morning and I feel bleary eyed and cranky. I'm about
halfway through preparing my morning coffee when I realize I'm dealing with
the effects of our delightful biannual tradition of time traveling that we have
all allowed to happen in the Year of Our Lord 2023. Hopefully this pot of Little
Waves _________________ puts a little pep in my step.

Just as with the audition it's raining the day of the callback. Back to the steed.

I check my inbox & at 11:22 AM I have a new message. I read the preview and feel
a slight lump in my throat.
**Good Morning, Thank you so much for attending the aud...**.
I tap the email fully expecting to see a big fat **but** right after "audition."
Thank you so much for attending the audition, *but we're going to go with someone
more experienced.*
Thank you so much for attending the audition, *but we've your dancing was not up to par.*
Thank you so much for attending the autition, *but what the hell were you thinking?*

I open the email & I'm relieved to find not a **but** but an invitation to a
callback. The first rehearsal was to start tomorrow but Mark has decided to hold
a callback instead of a rehearsal. I think that's good?


First song Patsy Cline probably listened to the CD hundreds of times. Listened
to Patsy in the old Mercury sedan before Johnny boy came along and we became a
minivan family. I can still
belt out *I Fall To Pieces*, *Crazy*, and *Walkin' After Midnight* in my sleep.
Woody Guthrie - God Bless Texas connection?


NYT page 45 of the June 19, 1978 edition, next to a photo from the South Lawn of
the White House with George Benson no doubt plucking some impossibly smooth
guitar riffs and Dizzy Gillespie leading President Carter in a rendition of
*Salt Peanuts, and above ads for Grease, Jaws 2, and Close 
Encounters of the Third Kind, The Paper of Record reports on the ADF moving from
its former home at Connecticut College, which closes with the line that the
American Dance Festival is "one of the nation's most important institutions."

Why you would like to participate in this process and perform this piece?

Because it’s a way to participate in the ADF that’s so far out of my comfort
zone that the green submit button below is simultaneously terrifying and exhilarating.

Perhaps it's the Oklahoma Catholic upbringing but I have a hard time
I love compliments but hate accepting them.
I feel proud for putting myself out there. I also realize I didn't win the Nobel Prize.
Would I have been as comfortable auditioning for a performance containing nudity
if I were a woman? I can't say for sure. What I can say for sure as someone who
has never performed, let alone performed in the nude, I never fretted over
potential harassment stemming from walking naked in a room full of strangers.
Concerns over the vulnerability that comes with that? Sure. Concerns with the
ambient temperature of the performing space? Absolutely.

Mark asks with a slight kick to the left foot of my vaguely animated corpse.

I partially peel open an eyelid and muster the strength for a single syllable,
"yeah"

"Sorry, but it's time to start rehearsal," Mark coyly remarks behind a Cheshire
cat smile that I am soon to become intimately familiar with over the course of
the next two weeks.

I scrape myself off the floor of the __________ studio at the American Dance
Festival, still reeling from

The performance

I exist in the dielectic state of craving praise while simultaneously being
wholly unable to accept it.

As rehearsals continue & get more runs under our belt we get more comfortable
with the piece. Less thinking and more emoting.

And then the Saturday before the shows I was feeling really comfortable.

And on the first nude pass I hit Mark with a pec blast.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Nothin' To Say</h4>
The most beautiful aspect of art in my opinion is that it's subjective. Every
person who experiences the art brings their life experience & perspective to the
piece

John Prine is one the the greatest American songwriters and I will challenge
anyone to a duel who opines otherwise.

John Prine recorded thousands of lines of recorded lyrical poetry and
certainly wrote tens of thousands more.

In the midst of every one of these lines there's one that drives a stake
deep into the soul of my being.

*How the hell can a person
Go to work in the morning
Then come home in the evening
And have nothing to say?*

As a poet this is a perfectly reasonable question.

As an introverted adolescent whose parents might ask him,

"What did you learn in school today?"

It's a *feeling*.

A feeling that puts you in an exact time and place that your brain is
incapable of forgetting. You faked the answer hundreds of times but for
whatever reason any time you think of the question you can remember the exact
stretch of pavement above which the question was proffered.

And the reason that I went to (school) in the morning then came home in the
evening and had nothing to say is that I just wanted to be alone. I didn't want
to talk to anyone.

I'm fully aware that Uncle John is singing about a failed marriage, but I think
this ties into the reason we crave art. Art is what makes us human. It's an
opinion. It's a disagreement. It's a guy holding onto the microphone too long
at a Q&A.

A bleh_____ will always __________ weigh bleh or something

That's science. And I love science. It's what got me through my adolescence.
The surety. The answers. The black & white. It's what helped make the world
make sense to me. If I was unsure of myself I could at least be sure of the
principles that _____ built upon the __ that__ built yadda yadda

You actually realize what catharsis means. You grab the grief with both hands
and knead it like dough. You sit with it. Your use your introversion
to your advantage. You realize you are a master contemplator. You're
comfortable being alone. You can sit with your thoughts. You can wrestle with
your thoughts. You embrace the pain. You walk through it instead of
around it.

You realize that you have just as much to say as anyone else. You realize that
you do have something to say. The words come gushing out. What the hell is our
word count now? Are you still reading this?

You gain enough confidence where self deprecation is funny and endearing insread
of worrying and tragic. You realize you have a super power. You also acknowledge
much of that power comes from all the seen and unseen advantages that come from
growing up as a white male in an upper middle class stable family in the
heartland of America. You wish everyone could be afforded the same opportunity.

Do you do anything 

Does he spend his time writing nonsense instead of helping the less fortunate?

Yes

Does he feel guilty about it?

Yes

If he says right here on his website that he will help the less fortunate

It sticks with me every time I hear it because I was that person. Substitute
school for work and I was that person that had nothing to say.


<h4 class="article-subheader">It's Art, Get It?</h4>
The most wonderful part of Mark's piece is the fact that there's no message.
There's no agenda. He presents the world the way he sees it and allows the
audience to come to their own conclusion.

At least that's my conclusion.

Rehaersal


Everyone got emotional

Whatever it was everyone had their ow emotion that they were going through.
All it was for me was just thinking about listening to FM 95.5 with my old man
in Tulsa
