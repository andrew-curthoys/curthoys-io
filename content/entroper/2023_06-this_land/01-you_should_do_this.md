summary: 

I open Instagram to find a message from my wonderful cousin Laura, a NYC-based
dancer. Laura is 5 days older and 5 times more mature than I. I have
<a href="/rambler/2021_11-nyc_marathon/marathon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">written</a>

<a href="/rambler/2021_11-nyc_marathon/marathon.html?id=ballet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura</a>
before and the amount of pixelated ink I have spilled of our adventures cannot
begin to describe the joy she brings to this world.

This particular missive
contains a link entitled *Audition for "This Land Is Your Land" by Mark Haim.*

Hmmm... ok, I'll bite.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
In honor of the ADF’s decade of collaborating with the Nasher Museum of Art, it
is bringing back a community favorite from 2013: Mark Haim’s “This Land Is Your
Land,” an evening-long dance based entirely on walking.
</div>

Well we're off to a good start, "entirely on walking" seems within my
capabilities. Hell I walk every day. Plus, "This Land Is Your Land" slides right
into a cozy pair of blue jeans and cowboy boots at the heart of my Oklahoma
pride. Tulsa is home to the Woody Guthrie Center and sits just 60 miles to
the Northeast of his hometown of Okemah. How 'bout that lil deal?

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Mark Haim would like to restage the dance for a group of 14 performers from the
NC community and is looking for a very diverse group in age, race, size and gender. 
</div>

Well.... it was fun while it lasted.

Of the roughly 1 million words in the English language, the descriptor
*diverse* would be nowhere near the top of the list for a mid-30s straight white
guy from Oklahoma.

But near the top of the list of descriptors for that demographic, you would be
sure to find "*misplaced confidence*", so I decide to apply anyway.

My 7 word response to Laura initiated the fueling procedures for a pair of
liquid rocket boosters programmed with a trajectory to launch me out of my
comfort zone we're headed to another planet. Buckle up.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Submit A Headshot</h4>
The deadline for applications is March 6th, exactly 5 weeks away. *Plenty* of
time to apply.

Application requirements:

* 150 word biography.
* A short description why you want to partake in this performance.
* Headshot.

To most people this probably seems like a piece of cake. Just knock it out
between walkin' the dogs & fixin' supper. But for someone with no relevant
experience what the heck should I include in my bio? And a ***short***
description why I want
to partake in this performance? I'd need 10 sessions with a psychologist to even
begin to answer that question.

Then the headshot. I feel like Kevin McCallister packing his suitcase.

SUBMIT.

A HEADSHOT!?

Woof.

Well at least I have over a month to think about it.

So I spend the month *thinking* and not a minute of *doing*.

As the March 6 deadline looms ever more sinister with each passing day I realize
my window to snag a headshot before departing for a Utah ski trip is rapidly
closing. While working from home on March 3rd ahead of my evening flight I spend
my entire lunch break struggling to capture an adequate headshot.

It started with a simple "headshot examples" google image search. A panoply of
aggressively beautiful people suddenly appears on my phone screen. Ok so all I
have to do is look natural and find a nice set of high cheekbones and chiseled
jaw in my size. I heard Costco is having a sale on *Robert Redford from The
Sting*.

After a few awkward selfies I'm horrified to discover that in the course of a
single morning of staring at a computer screen my forehead can generate an amount
of oil somewhere between the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon. I make a quick
call to FEMA to blast my face with industrial strength surfactants before
reattempting.

After degreasing I realize the electromagnetic radiation spilling into my
apartment from our noble star is much too bright. I'm going to need some sort of
shade. I take a quick inventory of my apartment and find the perfect high-tech
implement for the situation.

A used pizza box.

The only object in my domicile that could rival my forehead grease levels.

I hold the empty box above my head with my left hand and snap a selfie with my
right. This, of course, results in an asinine posture that's only surpassed in
stupidity
by the look of demented concentration scrawled across my face. I look like I'm
trying to take a photo while caught in a rain storm leaving Dominos.

Ok so that's not going to work.

Whatever, I probably won't get picked anyway. I'll just keep packing.

I stuff my ski boots, helmet, and jacket into my boot bag and update my
packing checklist.

Jacket &check;

Ski pants &check;

Gloves &check;

Helmet &check;

Goggles &check;

Boots &check;

Thermals &check;

Skis &check;

Poles &check;

Headshot &square;

That unchecked box gnaws at me.

My internal *Minister of Be Comfortable Being Uncomfortable*,
who I've been grooming the past few years for situations just like this, pipes
up - *it's not that big of a deal, just get a serviceable headshot and we'll head
to the airport and worry about the rest later*.

So I do the most logical thing I can think of - I wheel my bicycle around to the
brick wall, balance the pizza box on the handlebars, sit on the floor, and snap
the most *serviceable* headshot in the history of headshots.

If I knew I'd actually get the part I would have saved all the rejects for your
bemusement. As it stands I only have the final picture. Which should attest to
how bad the previous photos were.

Headshot &check;

<h4 class="article-subheader">The Performance Contains Nudity</h4>
At first you had my curiosity.

**Now** you have my attention.

As a complete outsider
to the world of dance and longtime denizen of the world of overthinking,
I couldn't help but ponder, "what exactly does '*contains
nudity*' mean?" Does *contains nudity* fall on a performance nudity scale that
I'm unaware of?

Suggests nudity  
&emsp;Teases nudity  
&emsp;&emsp;Flashes nudity  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Exhibits nudity  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*Contains nudity*  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Features nudity  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Showcases nudity  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Celebrates nudity  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Overdoes nudity

So... I stroll down to the Durham Public Library to see if I can find some answers.

On the top floor of the library I find the 20 volume collection of The Oxford
English Dictionary Second Edition, published Clarendon Press 1989. I scan the
spines until I land on *Volume III: Cham-Creeky*.

The principal historical dictionary of the English language lists no fewer than
17 definitions for the word "contains." The most pertinent for our purposes are
probably:

<ol start="2" class="dict-def">
<li>
	a: <span>To have as part (or the whole) of its contents or substance; to
comprise, include.</span>
<br>
	b: <span>Of a material body or substance: To have in it (as a constituent
	element or in combination)</span>
</li>
<li>
	a: <span>To include, comprise, extend over, measure.</span>
</li>
</ol>

but then we also have definitions 

<ol start="11" class="dict-def">
<li>
	a: <span>To restrain, hold in, keep in check; to hold back, keep back,
	hinder.</span>
<br>
	b: <span>To restrain, put restraint on, repress</span>
</li>
<li>
	<span>To restrict, limit, confine.</span>
</li>
</ol>

What does ***contains nudity*** mean?

What does contains nudity ***mean***?

<h4 class="article-subheader">Here Goes Nothin'</h4>
The night before the application deadline I navigate the USS Procrastination
through roiling seas in the ominous shadow of the rocky crags of Responsibility
Island.

I've been agonizing over these two simple prompts for weeks. I have a rough
outline of a biography written in fits and starts. Then there's the matter of
"why you would like to participate in this process and perform this piece?" The
more I think about it the less I know why.

After a killer day on the slopes at Park City, I ease into our family friend
LaGayle's recliner couch with my mom, LaGayle, and her
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/11-utah.html?id=dogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4 tiny dogs</a>.

LaGayle fires up the 2018 Jennifer Lawrence & Joel Edgerton dark spy thriller
*Red Sparrow* and I grab my laptop. I click, I clack, I make the final cuts
of the words that auditioned for inclusion in my bio. I don't realize it at the
time, but the backdrop of ballet dancers in the movie while I complete my
application feels like kismet.

As for the "why" - I throw out everything I have written down to this point and
just write how I feel at this moment.

	<figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
</figure>

And with that I click the green button, sending my application out into the
ether of the internet. At the very least I can rest easy knowing I won't have
the nagging question of "what if?"

<h4 class="article-subheader">Ohhh, So THAT'S What "Contains Nudity" Means</h4>
The next day after some incredible morning laps of waist deep powder, I head to
Umbrella Bar in Canyons Village at the base of Park City Mountain. I order
myself a bowl of chili and a Pint of Johnny's American IPA and pop open my
email.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Thank you for applying to audition for Mark Haim’s This Land Is Your Land
co-presented by ADF and the Nasher this summer. As mentioned in the audition
call, this performance contains nudity. Please watch the following video to
understand the scope of the performance.
<p class="text-center">...</p>
Once you have watched the video, respond to this email by tomorrow, March 7 to confirm that you will be in attendance at the audition. Nudity will not be part of the audition. More information regarding the audition will be shared following your confirmation.
</div>

Alright, let's give it a look. I open the link and start scrolling to finally
complete my quest to find the meaning of *contains*. We start fully clothed,
looks like a few wardrobe changes, then BAM! Full, ass out, flappin' in the
breeze nudity. So THAT'S what *contains* means.

I quickly realize I'm watching a group of naked strangers on my phone in the
middle of a crowded ski bar & slam my phone face down on the bar where it
remains for the rest of my meal. Don't want my other bar patrons to confirm
their suspicions I'm some sort of weirdo.

So *contains nudity=full nudity*. I'd be lying if I said I hadn't considered this
possibility. But now that it's confirmed I have a decision to make.

But first I have some more skiing to do.

	ski a run named "Twister"</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4 class="article-subheader">Well, We've Come This Far</h4>
When I get back to LaGayle's after the day's skiing I pull the video back
up. I want to watch it start to finish to see what I'd be getting myself into
should I choose to accept the mission.

A split second into the video I realize that I *have* to say yes. The
unmistakable, mesmerizing contralto of Patsy Cline snuggles up to me like an old
friend. I've probably listened to *Walkin' After Midnight* hundreds of times.
As kids our parents would play Patsy Cline CDs in our old Mercury sedan before
Johnny boy came along and we became a minivan family. I can still belt out
*I Fall To Pieces*, *Crazy*, and *She's Got You* in my sleep.

I watch the rest of the video to see the rest of the performance but my
decision has already been made.

*Hello Kelsey, I watched the performance and plan to attend the audition.*

There's no turning back now. Giddy up.
