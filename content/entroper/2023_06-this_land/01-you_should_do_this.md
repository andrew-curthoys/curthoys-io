summary: 

I'm minding my own business on a nondescript January morning when I receive an
Instagram message from my cousin Laura. Laura is a trained dancer in NYC who is
5 days older and 5 times more mature than I. I have
<a href="/rambler/2021_11-nyc_marathon/marathon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">written</a>

<a href="/rambler/2021_11-nyc_marathon/marathon.html?id=ballet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura</a>
before and the amount of pixelated ink I have spilled of our adventures cannot
begin to describe the joy she brings to this world.

This particular missive contains a link to a post by the American Dance
Festival with the headline
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CpLbgk9J-FI/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">*Audition Opportunity for NC-based Performers*</a>
Audition? Why on earth is she sending me a link to an audition? I've never
auditioned for anything in my life. I skeptically click the link.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
In honor of the ADF’s decade of collaborating with the Nasher Museum of Art, it
is bringing back a community favorite from 2013: Mark Haim’s “This Land Is Your
Land,” an evening-long dance based entirely on walking.
</div>

Well, now that you mention it, "based entirely on walking" seems squarely within
my capabilities, hell I walk every day. Plus, "This Land Is Your Land" slides
right into a cozy pair of blue jeans and cowboy boots sitting in the closet of
my Oklahoma pride. My childhood home sits just up the road a piece from the
Woody Guthrie Center, which itself is located a mere 60 miles Northeast of
Woodrow Wilson Guthrie's hometown of Okemah. How 'bout that lil deal?

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Mark Haim would like to restage the dance for a group of 14 performers from the
NC community and is looking for a very diverse group in age, race, size and gender. 
</div>

Welp....

It was fun while it lasted.

Of the roughly 1 million words in the English language, the descriptor
"diverse" would be nowhere near the top of the list for a mid-30s straight white
guy from Oklahoma.

However, you'd surely find "misplaced confidence" near the top of the same list
so I decide to apply anyway ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

My 7 word response to Laura initiated the fueling procedures for a Saturn V
rocket programmed to launch me out of my comfort zone and into another galaxy.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Submit A Headshot</h4>
The deadline for applications is March 6th, exactly 5 weeks away. *Plenty* of
time to apply.

Application requirements:

* 150 word biography.
* A short description why you want to partake in this performance.
* Headshot.

To most people this probably seems like a piece of cake. Just knock it out
between walkin' the dogs & fixin' supper. But for someone with no relevant
experience I haven't a clue what to include in my bio.

And a ***short*** description why I want to partake in this performance? I'd
need 10 sessions with a psychologist to even begin to answer that question.

Then the headshot. I feel like Kevin McCallister packing his suitcase.

SUBMIT.

A HEADSHOT!?

Woof.

Well at least I have over a month to think about it.

So I spend the month *thinking* and not a minute of *doing*.

As the March 6 deadline looms more sinister with each passing day I realize that
my window to snag a headshot before heading to Utah for a ski trip is rapidly
closing. While working from home ahead of my evening flight on March 3rd I spend
my entire lunch break struggling to capture an adequate headshot.

It started with a simple "headshot examples" image search. Suddenly a panoply of
aggressively beautiful people appears in my browser. Ok, so all I
have to do is look natural and find a nice set of high cheekbones and chiseled
jaw in my size. I'll take one *Robert Redford from The Sting* please.

After a few awkward selfies I'm horrified to discover that in the course of a
single morning of staring at a computer screen my forehead can generate an amount
of oil somewhere between the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon. I make a quick
call to FEMA to blast my face with industrial strength surfactants before
reattempting.

After degreasing I realize the electromagnetic radiation spilling into my
apartment from our noble star is much too bright. I'm going to need some sort of
shade. I take a quick inventory of my apartment and find the perfect high-tech
implement for the situation.

A used pizza box.

The only object in my domicile that could rival my forehead grease levels.

I hold the empty box above my head with my left hand and snap a selfie with my
right. This, of course, results in an asinine posture that's only surpassed in
stupidity
by the look of demented concentration scrawled across my face. I look like I'm
trying to take a photo while caught in a rain storm leaving Dominos.

Ok so that's not going to work.

Whatever, I probably won't get picked anyway. I'll just keep packing.

I stuff my ski boots, helmet, and jacket into my boot bag and update my
packing checklist.

Jacket &check;

Ski pants &check;

Gloves &check;

Helmet &check;

Goggles &check;

Boots &check;

Thermals &check;

Skis &check;

Poles &check;

Headshot &square;

That unchecked box gnaws at me.

My internal *Minister of Be Comfortable Being Uncomfortable*,
who I've been grooming the past few years for situations just like this, pipes
up - *it's not that big of a deal, just get a serviceable headshot and we'll head
to the airport and worry about the rest later*.

So I do the most logical thing I can think of - I wheel my bicycle around to the
brick wall, balance the pizza box on the handlebars, sit on the floor, and snap
the most *serviceable* headshot in the history of headshots.

If I knew I'd actually get the part I would have saved all the rejects for your
bemusement. As it stands I only have the final picture, which looks like I'm
Elder Andy standing on your front porch asking if you want a free book about
Jesus. Which should attest to how bad the previous photos were.

Headshot &check;

<h4 class="article-subheader">The Performance Contains Nudity</h4>
At first you had my curiosity.

**Now** you have my attention.

As a complete outsider
to the world of dance and longtime denizen of the world of overthinking,
I couldn't help but ponder, "what exactly does '*contains
nudity*' mean?" Does *contains nudity* fall on a performance nudity scale that
I'm unaware of?

Excludes nudity  
&emsp;Suggests nudity  
&emsp;&emsp;Teases nudity  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Flashes nudity  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*Contains nudity*  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Showcases nudity  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Flaunts nudity  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Celebrates nudity  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Overdoes nudity

So... I stroll down to the Durham Public Library to see if I can find some answers.

On the top floor of the DPL I find the 20 volume collection of The Oxford
English Dictionary Second Edition, published Clarendon Press 1989. I scan the
spines until I land on *Volume III: Cham-Creeky*.

The principal historical dictionary of the English language lists no fewer than
17 definitions for the word "contains." The most pertinent for our purposes are
probably:

<ol start="2" class="dict-def">
<li>
	a: <span>To have as part (or the whole) of its contents or substance; to
comprise, include.</span>
<br>
	b: <span>Of a material body or substance: To have in it (as a constituent
	element or in combination)</span>
</li>
<li>
	a: <span>To include, comprise, extend over, measure.</span>
</li>
</ol>

but then we also have definitions 

<ol start="11" class="dict-def">
<li>
	a: <span>To restrain, hold in, keep in check; to hold back, keep back,
	hinder.</span>
<br>
	b: <span>To restrain, put restraint on, repress</span>
</li>
<li>
	<span>To restrict, limit, confine.</span>
</li>
</ol>

What does ***contains nudity*** mean?

What does contains nudity ***mean***?

<h4 class="article-subheader">Application &check;</h4>
The night before the application deadline I navigate the USS Procrastination
through roiling seas in the ominous shadow of Responsibility Island's
craggy coastline.

I've been agonizing over two simple prompts for weeks. I have a rough
outline of a biography written in fits and starts. Then there's the matter of
"why you would like to participate in this process and perform this piece?" The
more I think about it the less I know why.

After a killer day on the slopes at Park City, I ease into the recliner couch
of our family friends Bob & LaGayle, who I stayed with during my
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/11-utah.html?=bob-lagayle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2022 Funemployment Ski Trip Jubilee</a>.
This trip to Utah I am joined by my mom, who cozies up on the other end of the
couch with LaGayle's 4 tiny dogs.

</figure>

<div id="red-sparrow" class="mb-3">
LaGayle fires up the 2018 Jennifer Lawrence & Joel Edgerton dark spy thriller
<i>Red Sparrow</i> and I grab my laptop. I click, I clack, I make final cuts
of the words that auditioned for inclusion in my bio. Five minutes into the flick
Jennifer Lawrence pirouettes onto the stage of the Bolshoi in a red and gold
tutu & bodice. I don't realize it at the time, but the background ballet ambience
while I complete my application now feels like kismet.
</div>

As for the "why" - I throw out everything I've written to this point and
just write how I feel at this moment.

	<figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
</figure>

And with that I click the green button, sending my application out into the
ether of the internet. At the very least I can rest easy knowing I won't have
the nagging question of "what if?"

<h4 class="article-subheader">Ohhh, So THAT'S What "Contains Nudity" Means</h4>
The next day after some incredible morning laps of waist deep Utah powder, I
head to Umbrella Bar in Canyons Village at the base of Park City Mountain. I
order myself a bowl of chili and a Pint of Johnny's American IPA and pop open
my email.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Thank you for applying to audition for Mark Haim’s This Land Is Your Land
co-presented by ADF and the Nasher this summer. As mentioned in the audition
call, this performance contains nudity. Please watch the following video to
understand the scope of the performance.
<p class="text-center">...</p>
Once you have watched the video, respond to this email by tomorrow, March 7 to
confirm that you will be in attendance at the audition. Nudity will not be part
of the audition. More information regarding the audition will be shared
following your confirmation.
</div>

Alright, let's give it a look. I open the link and start scrolling to finally
complete my quest to find the meaning of "contains". We start fully clothed,
cycle through a few wardrobe changes, then BAM! Full on, ass out, flappin' in
the breeze nudity. So THAT'S what *contains* means.

I quickly realize I'm watching a group of naked strangers on my phone in the
middle of a crowded ski bar & slam my phone face down on the bar where it
remains for the rest of my meal. Don't want my other bar patrons to confirm
their suspicions that I'm some sort of weirdo.

So *contains nudity=full nudity*. I'd be lying if I said I hadn't considered this
possibility. But now that it's confirmed I have a decision to make.

But first I have some more skiing to do.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Well, We've Come This Far</h4>
When I get back to LaGayle's after the day's skiing I pull the video back
up. I want to watch it start to finish to see what I'd be getting myself into
should I choose to accept the mission.

A split second into the video I realize that I *have* to say yes. The
unmistakable, mesmerizing contralto of Patsy Cline singing *Walkin' After
Midnight* snuggles up to me like an old friend. I've easily listened to this
song hundreds of times. As kids our parents would play Patsy Cline on repeat in
our old Mercury sedan before Johnny boy came along and we became a minivan
family. And then they played Pasty in the minivan. I can still belt out *Walkin'
After Midnight*, *I Fall To Pieces*, *Crazy*, and *She's Got You* in my sleep.

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
I stopped to see a weeping willow</br>
Crying on his pillow</br>
Maybe he's crying for me</br>
And as the skies turn gloomy</br>
Night winds whisper to me</br>
I'm lonesome as I can be
</div>

I watch the rest of the video to see the full performance but my
decision has already been made. I type up a quick email before hitting the sack.

*Hello Kelsey, I watched the performance and plan to attend the audition.*

There's no turning back now. Giddy up.
