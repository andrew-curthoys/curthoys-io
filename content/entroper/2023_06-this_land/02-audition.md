summary: 

<h4 class="article-subheader">Clean Pair Of White-Soled Sneakers</h4>
As someone who's never auditioned for anything I have no idea what to expect. I
tried out for baseball when I was 10 but I don't think cranking dingers is gonna
help me today.

I don't even know what to wear. The only guidance from the email was a clean pair of
white-soled sneakers. It also said there will be no nudity in the audition so
I should probably wear some clothes too. I opt for a pair of
breathable trousers and a plain dark v-neck. For the clean white-soled sneakers
I choose my white Asics that I wore to officiate my good friends Brady &
Shelby's wedding last summer. Maybe they got some magic in them yet.

Raining before original audition.

I arrive at ADF's Samuel H. Scripps Studios at quarter to 6 and check in
with Kelsey, who hands me number 170 to pin to my
shirt. Which can only mean one thing: I'm going to be the dancing equivalent of
Josh Allen, only 10 times better. They snap a quick picture,
ostensibly to get a photo with my number, but most likely because my headshot was
so amateurish.

I drop my bag on a bench in the reception area and tentatively stroll into the
studio. A dozen or so people are scattered about in various states
of stretching and mild calisthenics. I find a vacant patch of studio real estate
and do as the Romans do. To even the most generous of observers my stretches
would be considered *half assed*. I have to admit the Duke softball stadium
right outside the window has me wishing I was rippin' taters and turnin' double
plays.

Right around 6 PM our choreographer Mark Haim gathers everyone to *ahem* put us
through our paces.

I remember from my film study it's a constantly flowing series of 8 step
down & backs. I think I can handle that.

Mark divides the group into manageable chunks and watches everyone walk 8 step
laps without music.

1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 pivot  
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 pivot  
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 pivot  
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 pivot

A continuous series of  
"ope I forgot my keys, oh no they're in my pocket"  
"ope I forgot my keys, oh no they're in my pocket"  
"ope I forgot my keys, oh no they're in my pocket"  
"ope I forgot my keys, oh no they're in my pocket"

Mark then turns on some music & tells us to lead with our right foot on the 1
& pivot with our left on the 8.

right-left-right-left-right-left-right-left pivot  
right-left-right-left-right-left-right-left pivot  
right-left-right-left-right-left-right-left pivot  
right-left-right-left-right-left-right-left pivot  

*right-foot odds, left foot evens*  
*right-foot odds, left foot evens*  
*right-foot odds, left foot evens*  
*right-foot odds, left foot evens*  

After zigzagging in amorphous blobs Mark lines us up in groups of 8 to walk it
in unison. It takes me about three laps in the line to kind of get the hang of
it. A slight hubristic feeling of *y'know what? maybe I **can** do this*
overcomes me as I smugly walk back & forth with my compatriots.

Then Mark hits us with the gallops.

The gallop is an easy enough maneuver to execute on its own. A variation on the
skip where you raise your front leg for a little hop instead of bringing
your other leg through. I could gallop up & down the studio no problem.

The thing about the gallop, though, is that it switches your feet. Instead of
right foot odds, left foot evens we've entered the unfamiliar and sinister world
of left-foot odds, right-foot evens.

I cringe just thinking about it.

What's more, my comfy world of RFO-LFE is further upended by the fact that
switching feet means we switch the direction of our pivot.

**But** only on the laps with odd numbers of gallops.

I stand no chance.

<figure class="figure">

</figure>

We do a few laps in our blobs before Mark lines us back up to do it in
unison. I take one step and my brain freezes. I hop, I lurch, I trundle. But I
sure as hell don't gallop. The once steady count in my head violently sublimates,
forever lost to the steady, growing entropy of the universe. My grasp on the
very concept of numbers has become unsettlingly tenuous.

After a few rounds of gallops I glance over at the woman who is galloping with
the ease of Secretariat, my eyes as wide as saucers,

"I have NO idea what I'm doing."

"You're doing pretty good!" lies Renay.

"I've never auditioned for anything before so all this is completely new to me"

"Oh my god, are you serious? How did you hear about this?"

Before I can reply Mark rounds us up to explain a couple more maneuvers: the
Sally - a jaunty, carefree
frolic of a strut that's so fun to do you can't help but smile. The Lewiston -
a stiff, lumbering gait that reminds me of a wrestling coach.

Mark colors each character with a story of an interaction with that individual
or an archetype of the character. With each story I know exactly the person he's
describing. If I can embody that person is another question.

We do some Sallys, we do some Lewistons. Some good (Renay, Dana, Matt, et al.).
Some not so good (me).

Halfway through the audition Mark calls us all together again and drops a
terrifying line that sends shivers down my spine,

"We're going to go ahead and cut some folks right now, I *really* hate to do
this but we want to get some more looks at a smaller group."

This is the moment that I realize what an unbelievable opportunity I have. I
can see the genuine pain in Mark's face when he has to tell people they've
been cut. He's genuinely uncomfortable. I came into this on somewhat of a lark.
I had no idea what I was getting into. The choreographer could be an asshole.
The choreographer could have taken glee in cutting people. But each number he
reads *pains* him.

157

159

166

168

\**gulp*\*

172

176

\**phew*\*

He continues but I stop listening.

170 is safe.

For now.

One thing I might have going for me is we're now down to only 4 men at the
audition. It could just be a numbers game at this point. And I will certainly
not complain about getting let in on a technicality.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Durham Dance Mafia</h4>
We do much of the same for another hour or so, Shirleys, Lewistons, skips,
gallops... the fucking gallops... until Mark has seen all he needs to see and
releases us.

As we're all mulling about the reception area gathering all our belongings I
say to nobody and everybody all at once, 

"Anyone want to go grab a beer?" 

"Yeah, where were you thinking?" Dana cheerfully replies.

"Hell I don't care."

"Well I'm headed to Accordion Club if you want to join, I think a couple others
are coming. It's a great dive bar, I know all the bartenders."

"Oh I'm *very* familiar with Accordion Club. I love that place! See you there!"

Anticipating my condition I hitch up my 6 cylinder steed at my apartment
and set off to the saloon on foot. I show up to my new friends Dana, Renay, 
and Matt halfway through their first sarsparilla. I mosey over to a stool and
order up a Fairground Balloons Pale Ale.

We exchange our thoughts from the audition. Nobody thinks they are going to
get it. Everybody thinks everybody else is going to get it.

"This piece isn't about how much dance experience you have, it's more about your
look, your vibe, how you mesh with the aesthetic of the group."

"Well let's hope there's a guy-who-looks-like-Jesus spot in the aesthetic mesh."

After my craft pale ale I switch over to a bottle of swill that's more fitting
of an establishment of Accordion Club's class. The bartender pops the cap on my
PBR then just stares at me.

"Uhhhhh"

"You gotta guess the card," interjects Dana.

"The card?"

"Have you never gotten a PBR at Accordion?"

"I reckon not."

"The bottle caps have cards printed on the underside of them, if you guess the
card & suit you get the beer for free."

"Oh how fun! Give me the 7 of spades!"

"Close, 8 of spades."

I resist the urge to explain that probabilistically it's just as close as any
other card, assuming the caps are evenly distributed of course.

And then explain it anyway.

Because I'm an annoying twat. I can't help it.

"So as someone who has never attended an audition I have to say that Mark was
super nice and the whole audition was actually kinda fun. I'm assuming that's
not how it always goes?"

Dana, Renay, & Matt all have a similar answer. Some choreographers are nice,
some are assholes, and some fill in the space between. I'm chuffed that Mark
falls on the nice end of the spectrum.

One PBR turns to two then Dana shows up to the table with a round of tequila
shots. Oh sweet baby Jesus, I was not prepared for this.

"Here's to everybody making it. Here's to the Durham Dance Mafia!"

<h4 class="article-subheader">Callback</h4>
My alarm squawks the next morning and I feel bleary eyed and cranky. About
halfway through preparing my morning coffee I realize I'm dealing with
the effects of our delightful biannual daylight savings tradition that we have
all allowed to happen in the Year of Our Lord 2023. Hopefully this pot of Little
Waves Dinkinesh: Yukro medium roast Ethiopian jitter juice puts a little pep in
my step.

As I'm milling about the apartment I receive an email at 11:22 AM. I read the
preview and feel a slight lump in my throat.  

*Good Morning, Thank you so much for attending the aud...*

I tap the email fully expecting to see a big fat **but** right after "audition."

Thank you so much for attending the audition, **but** *we're looking for someone
with a little more experience.*  
Thank you so much for attending the audition, **but** *we've decided that your
dancing was not up to par.*  
Thank you so much for attending the audition, **but** *what the hell were you thinking?*

I open the email & I'm relieved to find not a **but** but an invitation to a
callback. I think that's good?

*Thank you so much for attending the audition last night! Instead of holding a
first rehearsal this Sunday, Mark would like to hold a callback.* ***You are
invited to attend the callback.***

The callback takes place the next morning, where we work through all the hits
again. After about an hour we take a break and while we're all relaxing on the
benches in the reception area of the studio Marks strides in with an
announcement he delivers in the most understated tone possible,

"Ok so this is technically a callback but I like what I see and we're going to
move forward with this group. So you've all made it. Is everyone comfortable
continuing? We'll consider this the first rehearsal."

Everyone shares shocked looks of unexpected excitement and mild bewilderment.
Of course we're comfortable continuing. The mood of the studio lightens and we
spend the next two hours rehearsing and adding new elements to the piece.

I'm happy to report that all 4 founding members of the Durham Dance Mafia, Dana,
Matt, Renay, and yours truly made the team. I'm glad we didn't have to resort to
making Mark an offer he couldn't refuse.

So... I guess I'm going to be performing at American Dance Festival?

<h4 class="article-subheader">American Dance Festival</h4>
The American Dance Festival is a Durham-based dance studio and school dedicated
to supporting, presenting, and teaching modern dance. From their website,

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
Since 1934, the American Dance Festival has been a recognized leader in modern
dance presenting dance performances, and offering educational opportunities and
community programs, while maintaining an international reach.
<br>
​​ADF ensures that modern dance remains a powerful and universal form of human
expression and that this art form is accessible to all, now and for generations
to come.
</div>

The festival traces its origins to the Bennington School of the Dance, a summer
program established at Bennington College in Vermont. The school provided
choreographers and performers a venue to experiment and perform works in the
rapidly evolving medium of modern dance. In 1948 the festival was relocated to
Connecticut College before it's final move to the 36th parallel in 1978.

(*Fun fact:* one side of the road outside the Nasher
Museum of Art where the performance will be held is at 35.99999&deg;N and the
other is 36.0&deg;N. I'm comfortable admitting that I'm probably the only weirdo
who finds that fact fun.)

The move to Durham was chronicled in the June 19, 1978 issue of The New York
Times. On
<a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1978/06/19/issue.html?login=email&auth=login-email" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">page 45</a>,
next to a photo from the South Lawn of
the White House featuring George Benson plucking some impossibly smooth
guitar riffs and Dizzy Gillespie leading President Carter in a rendition of
*Salt Peanuts*, The Paper of Record details the 45th season of the festival.
It feels poetic that ADF is celebrating its 90th anniversary this season,
exactly 45 years on from the first performances on Duke's campus.

That 1978 class featured a young 19-year old student by the name of Madonna
Ciccone, but today we just know her by her first name. A story that ran in the
Charlotte Observer detailing the festival began thusly,

*Her name is Madonna Ciccone, and her face matches her name.*

*Round eyes, arched eyebrows, finely drawn mouth – Da Vinci would have loved it.
It is a theatrical face, a dancer’s face. And she has a dancer’s body – thin as
a blade, lithe and agile. Doll-like, she looks as if she’d snap in a strong wind.*

*She wouldn’t.*

This year's festival is dedicated to Gerri Houlihan, a colossus in the world of
dance who is celebrating her 40th season teaching at the ADF summer intensive.
A graduate of The Julliard School and former Dean of the ADF School, her
accomplishments and accolades are far too extensive to detail here, but I
encourage everyone to read about her magnificent career
<a href="https://americandancefestival.org/2023/05/03/adf-dedicates-its-90th-anniversary-season-to-gerri-houlihan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>,
and if you have the means, consider donating a few shekels to the Gerri
Houlihan Scholarship Fund. I had the
pleasure to meet Gerri at one of our rehearsals and look forward to attending
one of her classes, where she continues to advance the mission of ADF.

This season features two companies who performed at the inaugural Durham
festival, the Paul Taylor Dance Company and Pilobolus, the latter of which
former president of ADF Charles Reinhart described as "a mushroom at the family
tree of modern dance." In the final line of the 1978 article, the NYT described
ADF as "one of the nation's most important institutions."

No pressure.



After the first week we start putting together our costumes.
