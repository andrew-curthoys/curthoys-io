<h4 class="article-subheader">About That Whole Nudity Thing</h4>
I'll admit when I first saw the video of the Paris performance with *full
nudity* I felt an initial jolt of anxiety mixed with excitement mixed with
trepidation. The trepidation quickly gave way to a rolling cascade of immature
mirthfulness. In short order, I dispatched a flurry of texts to my similarly
puerile pals riddled with cosmopolitan aphorisms such as "hanging dong" and
"cock out walk out." My only
preparation, mental or otherwise, was a diet and workout program - because
who would know about vainglorious pursuits more than a man who built an entire
website to write about himself?

But I don't want to breeze over the nudity because it's such an integral part
to the piece's bold creativity. And my experience as a straight white male
non-dancer is not representative of the rest of the company. As I listened to
discussions of the nudity during rehearsal breaks I decided that I'd like to
share a more diverse breadth of experiences than my own.

Spanning over 5 decades in age and a wide variety of backgrounds, the cast's
journey to acceptance with the nudity was anything but uniform. While it was a
completely novel experience for me, some of my co-performers had performed nude in
the past. Most had attended performances with nudity. All understood that nudity
is a form of artistic expression that has been around as long as dance has been
around.

But how do you have that conversation with your partner? With your children?
With your grandchildren? How do you draw the discussion from the realm of taboo
to the realm of artistic expression? And why is nudity taboo to begin with?

Each member of the cast has traveled their own body image journey to reach the
point where we are today. We're all comfortable . But that's just the start.
The most significant mental hurdle was not comfort with our own bodies
but comfort with *others* seeing our bodies. Comfort with their
gaze. Comfort with their judgement. Because of
society's varying body image expectations based on age, gender,
race, or sexual orientation that was an easier journey for some than others.

The performers active in the North Carolina dance scene (which was most of the
dancers) were further confronted with the anxiety of performing nude in front of
colleagues, collaborators, community leaders, mentors, teachers, or students (an
anxiety I avoided because I emphatically told my coworkers not to come). When I
chatted with Dana about this aspect she relayed that it "was a question of
making sure the people in my life and in my community who know me
professionally, and outside of the dance sphere, were going to be ok with seeing
me naked... Will they still respect me? Will they see me from now on in a work
or other public event setting and imagine me naked?"

But when she brought it up with these same people nobody took issue with it. "It
gave me the courage to be vulnerable and embrace my racing thoughts and fears as
informative steps towards self-awareness rather than be paralyzed by them."
Because through nudity we share "a trust that exists when we reveal ourselves
whether physically or emotionally - and dance includes both." 

One performer mentioned that her friends, when she told them about the nude
section, all looked at her husband, *what do you think about that?* As if it was
an act of infidelity. Because our society has so strongly linked nudity with
sexuality it's hard to dissociate the two. It's rare in this country to see
nudity in a non-sexual setting.
But there's nothing inherently sexual about nudity. And there's nothing
inherently wrong about sexuality (but that's another discussion altogether).

Alyce came to the piece with a combination of fear and excitement, "it started
out as a challenge, can I really do this?" Writing in her
<a href="https://view.flodesk.com/emails/6495a0b1d74d9c624c07fe81" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
newsletter</a>, she discussed her first screening of the Paris video, "there was
an elegance of humanness in the vase range of bodies I observed on the screen.
It was raw, real, it made my heart pound and my eyes were locked in." When
considering committing to the piece she felt that if she said yes she could
"honor the body and what it's capable of and what it was been capable of
creating for my career and for my life."

During the rehearsals and the performance Alyce felt a sense of calm, "I saw it
as a moving meditation. During that moment I felt so connected with the group
even though we never really came in contact with each other. That just became
a peaceful moment." Again, from her newsletter, "I gave myself permission to be
me, in my skin, in my body. I celebrated each moment and each movement. I felt
loved and seen. I fell in love with myself and the cast."

Perhaps Alyce's proudest achievement from the piece is teaching these valuable
lessons to her daughter Amelia. It was a valuable lesson to 

Other performers discussed the counterintuitive concept that the nude section
actually felt the least *intimate* section of the piece. For Cate, an action as
simple as smiling during our Shirley passes felt more intimate than the nudity.
"During that section we're sharing a part of ourselves, whereas the nude
section we're just bodies... it felt empowering because my body just existed,
free from all our societal expectations." This realization helped her, along
with a number of other performers, mentally prepare for the nudity and deprive
it of its power.


1:45 Honoring the body and what it's capable of and what it has been capable of creating
for my career for my life, I couldn't take my eyes off of it. It was just
fascinating.

2:50 I felt really called to challenge myself

4:15 it started out as a challenge, can I really do this?

6:05 I saw it as a moving meditation. During that moment I felt so connected
with the group even though we never really come in contact with each other. That
just became a peaceful moment.

15:00 It was such a mental breakthrough for me to feel at ease in my body in that
moment and it felt like an opportunity to open the door to change narratives.

17:00 our spirits are not our bodies, they are just a vessel & they are vessels
that do miraculous things, which is why we need to honor and respect that

19:00 Mark is a magnetic spirit and the whole piece is *intentional*

Going full circle back to to
<a href="/entroper/2023_06-this_land/01-you_should_do_this.html?id=red-sparrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Sparrow</a>,
Jennifer Lawrence grappled with accepting the role, knowing it called for nudity.
Her trepidation stemmed from a nude photo leak that sent her into a "long period
when I didn't want to be seen sexually and I didn't want anybody to see my flesh."
Looking back on the role
(<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/arts/dance/jennifer-lawrence-red-sparrow-kurt-froman-isabella-boylston.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which required her to learn dance</a>),
Lawrence
reflected, “It took a while to say yes – and the night before I didn’t sleep at
all... But then after I finished the scene, I felt empowered.”

For us, we felt empowered because we had the privilege to participate in such a
wonderfully provocative work of art. We all saw the mastery in the way Mark
crafted the piece. Furthermore, Mark created a safe space with his tone that
carried through from the audition to the final performance that emphasized
comfort, calm, and acceptance. Alyce said she felt comfortable with the nudity
because "Mark is a magnetic spirit and the whole piece is *intentional*."

Reflecting on our first nude-involved rehearsal, Cate explained,
"that was the day I was like 'ok this is going to be fine,' because everybody
was just very professional and very chill. It's only a big deal if you make it
a big deal, and nobody was making it a big deal."

And when you think about it, it's really not that big of a deal.

Because at the end of the day we're all just *bodies*.

Bodies that shit and piss and sweat and fart and wrinkle and bleed and stink and
creak and groan and grow hair in the worst places and lose hair in the best.

The more we strip away the more we realize how similar we all are.

And I think we could all use a little reminder of that from time to time.
