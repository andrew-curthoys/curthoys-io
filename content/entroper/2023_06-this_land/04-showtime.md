<h4 class="article-subheader">Nothin' To Say</h4>
Art is by its very nature a subjective human pursuit. There's no one way, no
right way, no wrong way to create, consume, or appreciate it. Every person
brings their life experience & perspective to their interpretation.

In 1971's *Angel From Montgomery*, American mail carryer and occasional writer
of profound poetry John Prine croons,

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
How the hell can a person<br>
Go to work in the morning<br>
Then come home in the evening<br>
And have nothing to say?
</div>

Which, on the face of it, is a perfectly reasonable question.

But as an introverted young man I came home from school every day and had nothing
to say. I spent hundreds of excruciating car rides dreading the inevitable "what
did you learn in school today?" The thing is I learned plenty in school. I just
wanted to be alone.

But as I've matured and grown I've come to realize there's nothing wrong with
that. There's nothing to be ashamed of. I can be comfortable with *who I am*.
And if you're comfortable with who you are you can deal with uncomfortable
situations. You can fly towards Mount Awkward instead of around it.

So why in the hell am I telling you this?

Because there's absolutely no way that John Prine, when writing about the
failing marriage of a middle aged woman, thought about how the journey of a 35
year man would color his interpretation of the song. Because every single
person who enjoys art brings their own life story to it.

It's such a unique and captivating piece that every single audience member walks
away from the performance with a different perspective. The first time I watched
a recording of the piece I made an immediate connection to what I considered the
most powerful section of the performance, and Woody Guthrie's *This Land Is Your
Land*. But that's just the Oklahoma in me. And I'm sure every single person at
the Nasher made a connection to the piece that felt just at powerful and
profound to them.

The most wonderful part of Mark's piece is the fact that there's no message.
There's no agenda. He presents the world the way he sees it and allows the
audience to come to their own conclusion.

At least that's my conclusion.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Dress Rehearsal</h4>
The day before our first performances we mosey over to the Nasher for a full
dress rehearsal in the performance space. I've yet to grace the halls of the
museum so I'm blown away by the asymmetrical 5-sided glass roof. I stand and
stare at the beams that are beautifully engineered to support the load without
any spanning the whole distance of the roof. Each beam supports each other,
somewhat like the way you can fold the top flaps of a cardboard box to stay
shut without tape.

In the words of Rafael Vi&ntilde;oly, the Uruguayan-born architect,
<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
A collection of five separate, rectangular volumes arranged in a loose radial
pattern near the top of a gentle slope define an irregular, pentagonal central
courtyard topped by a glass roof. The complex, almost vertiginous geometries of
the atrium roof are formed by a hierarchy of structural systems, all supported
on five primary beams. This seemingly simple network of structural supports adds
rhythm, lightness, scale, and openness to the column-free public lobby and event
space at the heart of the museum and also incorporates the buildingâ€™s mechanical
systems.
</div>

It's a pretty magical space. And my first introduction to the mindfuck
that occurs when you leave the familiar confines of your home rehearsal space.
Our first dress rehearsal at the Nasher I make mistakes I haven't made in over
a week. I can't keep my count. I can't remember my choreography. I'm
discombobulated. It certainly doesn't help that the floor tiles are slanted at
an angle oblique to our walking path.

After the run through I ask the other performers if they had similar
tribulations and they confirm they did as well.

"Every time you rehearse at a new place that will happen. You'll be alright,
that's why we did this."

Phew. Did I mention my co-performers are fabulous people?

For our second dress rehearsal we get an audience. Members of the ADF staff and
participants in the summer dance intensive who have schedule conflicts with the
nights of the performance are offered the opportunity to see our final dress.
Much the same as the venue adds a new layer to the performance, a live audience
significantly changes the dynamic. I'm grateful that we are able to rehearse in
the Nasher with an audience before opening night. As an engineer I'm always on
the lookout to isolate as many variables as possible.

<h4 class="article-subheader">This Is It, Don't Get Scared Now</h4>
Rehearsals have worn me down and I'm ready for the real thing. I've got my
system down, I've got my spreadsheets printed. I've got Linda Belans's
spreadsheets printed. I'm prepared. Calm. Confident.

The night before our first performance I sleep like a damn baby. When I arise
I find a ladybug on my pillow - that's gotta be good luck right? But then again,
maybe I
<a href="https://dancespirit.com/history-of-merde/" target="_blank" rel="noopener no referrer">don't want good luck</a>?
I'm not really sure what to make of dancer superstitions. Best not leave
anything to chance.

The hours leading up to the first performance are filled with much milling
about and nonsensical banter. Our heroic stage manager, Gabby, has the
unenviable job of appeasing contingents from the Nasher, the ADF, and the
security detail, all while wrangling a group of nervy performers.

15 minutes before showtime Gabby leads us from the green room backstage. We chat
idly, review notes, stretch out, waiting anxiously just to get the show on the
road. 6:30 comes and goes.

"These things never start on time, I'm sure there are still people shuffling in"

A few minutes later Gabby comes backstage and calmly tells us we'll be starting
in 5.

*I go out walkin' after midnight...*


<h4 class="article-subheader">Focus</h4>
On my first pass my biggest point of concentration is to keep my gaze above the
heads of the audience, staring off into that deep blue lake.
The audience is seated on folding chairs surrounding the stage on three sides.
One of my biggest points of concentration is to keep my
gaze above the heads of the audience, staring off into that deep blue lake. I do
this because it's what Mark told us to do, but mostly because I know if I make
eye contact with a friend I'll immediately crack up.

I didn't have anyone come the first day, but I didn't know that at the time. The
second day I had friends confirmed for both shows so it's good I had my gaze
fixing practice night 1. During the first performance of the second day I did
catch myself smothering a smirk during the nude section. Facing out towards the
audience I maintained a stoic stare into the deep blue lake, but going back
towards the curtain each time I had the smallest smirk I had to muffle.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Giddy</h4>
On my third pass I'm supposed to do a single skip on each of the first two laps
then three skips each on the next two. First lap I nail it. The best skip you've
ever laid eyes on. No notes. The second lap, however, I get a little
overexuberant and hit the three skips one lap too early. I try to play it off as
best I can and finish out the pass with no further gaffes.

Behind the curtain I look to Cate,

"Ugh I accidentally did 3 skips on the second lap. Whoops!"

"OMG I did too!"

"Ha! No way! I guess we're just a little over excited for our first performance"

"Definitely"

Seeing as we were in the middle of the line when we committed our faux pas it
very well could have looked intentional. At least that's what we tell ourselves
as we prepare for our next pass. No time to dwell on the past.

With my gaffe in the rearview I'm soon to my absolute favorite part of the piece.
The pouty pause. On my last lap of plastic surgery I stop for a 4 count at the
end of the stage and give the audience the look of petulant, bratty child who
was just told they couldn't have ice cream. "You're a bratty kid who didn't get
their way and you want to stare at them like you're parents are the worst."

The rest of the show goes off without a hitch. No more gaffes, blunders, or
goofs. I feel pretty good about it, my confidence, it seems, was not misplaced.

In the second performance I completely lost my count on one of my sideways
passes with skips and just had to wing it. I lost my instruments and just had
to go on feel. Since we had run it through so many times I had gotten a good
feel for my steps and skips. Each skip I had a pretty good feel for when to
fire it off, but luckily I had Renay next to me who really loaded up for each
skip so I could confirm my hunch that it was time for a skip by looking at my
peripherals.

My last pass comes as the music fades out to silence. 96 steps of silence. I'm
the very last in the line so my final lap is all alone. No music to keep my
count. No comrades to distract the audience's gaze.

Seeing as this is my first performance (have I mentioned that yet?) my fellow
dancers ask if I'm nervous for my solo. I have a troubling sense of calm about
it. I should be nervous but for reasons I can't explain I'm not. Chalk it up to
preparation.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Quick Change</h4>
Throughout the course of the 1 hour piece I have 13 different looks. Each doesn't
require a full outfit change, some are just an accessory here, new top there,
different pair of jeans. But a substantial wardrobe to keep track of nonetheless.
Before each performance I neatly stack each article of clothing in reverse order
of their appearance.

<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/entroper/2023_06-this_land/perf-wardrobe_before.jpeg" alt="Before">
</figure>

And each costume change I frantically tear off my clothes & throw them into a
pile. Entropy increasing with every pass.

<figure class="figure">

</figure>

Much like Rabbit's maps in Twister I've found that the most effective way to
prepare my socks is to roll them.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Ovation</h4>
I didn't know what to expect as I walked off the stage to finish my first ever
performance. I gave it a 50-50 shot
that I'd get emotional and tear up backstage but when it was all said and done
the only emotion I feel is pure, unadulterated bliss. My smile spans the full
distance between my ears

As we're hugging backstage I realize that I might not be the only one with first
show jitters. Our curtain call song, a delightful honky tonk swing ditty from
Patsy, has not made its usual appearance. In its stead an anticipatory applause
and wide-eyed looks of confusion among the cast. As we're pondering if we should
just take our curtain call without music Patsy starts up. But it's not the right
Patsy. It's *Walkin' After Midnight*, the opening song to the piece. It seems
the technician in charge of the music ran into a snafu playing the song and
made the tactical decision to just play the soundtrack from the piece. We shrug
and run out for the curtain call just like we practiced.

Backstage after the curtain call McKelynn looks at me with a huge smile on her
face, "oh my god they gave us a standing ovation! That doesn't happen every
time!"

"Well for me it does!" I reply with a shiteating grin. I'm an ornery prick
aren't I?

<h4 class="article-subheader">Are you going to the talkback?</h4>
"The what?"

"The talkback, Mark is going to talk about the piece & do a Q&A"

"Y'all have terms like *adagio* and *pli&eacute;* but the forum where a
choreographer discusses their art and creative process is called a talkback?"

*annoyed glares*

"Yes I'm going to the talkback"

I'm just saying that even football coaches have *postgame press conferences*.
I doubt half the coaches in the NFL could spell "conferences." A quarter
probably can't spell "press."

During the talkback we learn about the story of how the piece came to be. Our
current hour-long iteration was incrementally developed over time, with the
original spanning a much more modest 20 minutes.

Do I feel brave?
No
Do I feel proud?
Absolutely

When people ask me how the performance went I say the same thing every time, "it
was one of the most fun experiences of my life." From the moment I walked through
the door for the audition to the moment we took our final bow it was an
unrelenting torrent of joy. A ton of work. But a ton of fun.

I want to thank all my fellow performers for their patience putting up with my
asinine questions and inane jokes of mediocre quality:
Alexandra
Renay
Matt
Cate
Allie
Hendri
McKelynn
Carrie
Andy
Alyce
Jonathan
Brace
Dana
Linda Belans
Aaron

But most of all I want to thank Mark Haim for taking a chance on a hayseed from
Oklahoma with no dane experience to participate in a piece that's so meaningful
to him.
