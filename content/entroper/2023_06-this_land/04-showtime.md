Recently on one of my favorite podcasts, *Penpals* hosted by my two favorite
cackling idiots

<h4 class="article-subheader">It's Art, Get It?</h4>
Art is by its very nature a subjective human pursuit. There's no one way, no
right way, no wrong way to create, consume, or appreciate it. Art is intimately
individual and that's where it derives its beauty. Y'know, the eye of the
beholder and whatnot.

Mark Haim's *This Land Is Your Land* is an extreme exercise in subjective
interpretation. The piece is so
unique and captivating that no two audience members will walk out of
the Nasher with the same perspective. And each perspective is perfectly valid.

Even the stage is set up to encourage unique experiences. Arranged in a
configuration that I just learned is known as a "thrust stage," the audience
surrounds the stage on three sides. Personally, I'd call it the "Easy Company"
but Mark calls it an
*interactive viewing experience*. Audience members who are seated directly
facing the stage are treated to a completely different show than those on
the flanks. So even the same person watching the same show from two different
seats may interpret it differently.

The first time I watched the Paris recording I made an immediate connection
between Woody Guthrie's *This Land Is Your Land* and what I considered to be the
most powerful section Mark's *TLIYL*. But that's just the Oklahoma in me.
Everyone who watches will surely make a connection that feels
just as profound to them as my Woody Guthrie connection did to me.

The most wonderful part of the piece is the fact that there's no message.
There's no agenda. Mark simply presents the world the way he sees it and allows
the audience to come to their own conclusion.

At least that's my conclusion.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Dress Rehearsal</h4>
On opening night eve we mosey over to the Nasher for a full dress rehearsal in
the *interactive viewing experience*. I've yet to grace the halls of the
Nasher and when I stroll into its capacious atrium I'm blown away by the
asymmetrical 5-sided glass roof. The most marvelous aspect is the fact that
the load is shared by 5 beams conjointly supporting a web of glass and steel
without any beams spanning the full breadth of the room. It's somewhat like
that classic dad trick of folding the flaps of a cardboard box to stay shut
without tape. I ogle until my neck hurts. It's a beautiful piece of engineering.

In the words of Rafael Vi&ntilde;oly, the Uruguayan-born architect, the Nasher
was designed as
<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
A collection of five separate, rectangular volumes arranged in a loose radial
pattern near the top of a gentle slope define an irregular, pentagonal central
courtyard topped by a glass roof. The complex, almost vertiginous geometries of
the atrium roof are formed by a hierarchy of structural systems, all supported
on five primary beams.
<br><br>
This seemingly simple network of structural supports adds
rhythm, lightness, scale, and openness to the column-free public lobby and event
space at the heart of the museum and also incorporates the building’s mechanical
systems.
</div>

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Look at that roof! Vertiginous geometries!</figcaption>
</figure>

It's a truly magical venue. It's also my first introduction to the bewildering
experience of rehearsing in a new space. During our first dress
at the Nasher I make mistakes I haven't made in over a week. I can't keep my
count. I can't remember my
choreography. I'm fully discombobulated. It certainly doesn't help that the
floor tiles are slanted at an angle oblique to our walking path.

After the run through I ask my fellow performers if they had similar
struggles and they confirm as much.

"Every time you rehearse at a new place that will happen. You'll be alright,
that's why we did this."

Phew. Did I mention my co-performers are fabulous people?

For our second dress rehearsal we are graced with an audience. Members of the
ADF staff and
participants in the summer dance intensive who have schedule conflicts with the
nights of the performance are offered the opportunity to see our final dress.
Much the same as the venue adds a new layer to the performance, a live audience
significantly changes the dynamic. I'm grateful that we are able to rehearse in
the Nasher with an audience before opening night. As an engineer I'm always on
the lookout to isolate as many variables as possible.

Then right before the first performance Mark adds another variable.

"Andy, I know we haven't practiced this but I want you to grab the spear from
Cate and carry it offstage."

Sure thing, Mark, let's just throw a last minute curveball to the only dancer
with absolutely no dance experience who'd be more comfortable hitting a
*literal* curveball. No way that could possibly end up in disaster.

"Yeah, no problem," I say with a false confidence that hopefully hides the fact
that it's at the very least a small problem.

So I practice
the spear handoff a few times with Cate, a move that requires a pirouette
in the opposite direction of what we've been practicing the last couple weeks.
And of course a last minute scribble on my spreadsheet.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Opening Night</h4>
Outside of the 11th hour spearouette addition I feel ready. Rehearsals have
worn me down and I'm ready for the real thing. I've got my
system down. I'm prepared. Calm. Confident.

That night I sleep like a damn baby. When I arise
I find a ladybug on my pillow - that's gotta be good luck right? But then again,
maybe I
<a href="https://dancespirit.com/history-of-merde/" target="_blank" rel="noopener no referrer">don't want good luck</a>?
I'm not really sure what to make of dancer superstitions.

I arrive to the Nasher a couple hours ahead of our 6:30 PM show. Around 4:30
we do a tech rehearsal, which I learn is just a breezy run-through with the
music but no costumes or props. Like a Thursday football practice with no pads.

<figure class="figure container-fluid">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Notice how everyone else is focused on
  the task at hand whilst yours truly sticks his tongue out at the camera</figcaption>
</figure>

The time between tech & the performance is filled with much milling
about and nonsensical banter. Our heroic stage manager, Gabby, has the
unenviable job of appeasing contingents from the Nasher, ADF, and the
security detail, all while wrangling a group of nervy performers.

<figure class="figure container-fluid">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Durham Dance Mafia album cover</figcaption>
</figure>

15 minutes before showtime Gabby leads us from the green room backstage. We chat
idly, review notes, stretch out, waiting anxiously just to get the show on the
road. 6:30 comes and goes.

Dana reassures me, "these things never start on time, I'm sure there are still
people shuffling in"

A few minutes later Gabby comes backstage and calmly tells us we'll be starting
in 5. And in 5 minutes I'm greeted, once again, by that familiar contralto,

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
I go out walkin' after midnight...
</div>

I relax on my chair for a few minutes, observing the organized chaos backstage.
For each of their early passes, Alexandra, Renay, Matt, Cate, Allie, Hendri, and
McKelynn are forced to make a frantic backstage scramble. They have 12 counts to
make it from one edge of the curtain to the other, lest they miss their mark for
their next pass. The frenzied scurrying continues until Carrie joins the ranks,
providing a much needed respite for the beleaguered troops.

Around 4 minutes into the piece, I arise from my comfortable lounged position,
grab a cup and step in line right behind Cate.

*1 - 2 - 3 - 4*

And Cate is off.

*5 - 6 - 7 - 8*

I take a step up to my mark at the edge of the curtain.

*1 - 2 - 3 - 4*

And on the 5 I take my first step onto the stage in my inaugural performance as
a dancer.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Quick Change</h4>
Throughout the course of the 1 hour piece I have 13 different looks. Each doesn't
require a full outfit change, some are just an accessory here, new top there,
different pair of jeans. But a substantial wardrobe to keep track of nonetheless.
Before each performance I neatly stack each article of clothing in reverse order
of their appearance.

<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/entroper/2023_06-this_land/perf-wardrobe_before.jpeg" alt="Before">
</figure>

And each costume change I frantically tear off my clothes & throw them into a
pile. Entropy increasing with every pass.

<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/entroper/2023_06-this_land/perf-wardrobe_after.jpeg" alt="After">
</figure>

If only the audience could see the organized chaos unfolding backstage. A
sweaty maelstrom of flying blouses, jettisoned jeans, and the occasional mad
dash to get in position just before your entrance. It took a few rehearsals for
everyone to get the hang of it. During one rehearsal Alyce doles out a nugget of
wisdom that could only have been acquired through years of dance,

"If you coat the inside of your jeans with baby powder it helps get them on
when you're sweaty!"

I look at her with a bemused smirk,
"If you would have told me on New Year's Eve that in 2023 I would hear 'if you
coat the inside of your jeans with baby powder' I would have thought 'well 2023
is gonna be a weird year."

The trickiest part of my costume changes is the socks. It took me a couple
rehearsals to discover that much like Rabbit's maps in Twister the most
effective way to prepare my socks is to roll them.

<div class="tenor-gif-embed mb-3" data-postid="14663539" data-share-method="host" data-aspect-ratio="1.92771" data-width="100%"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/twister-rabbit-wise-good-gif-14663539">Twister Rabbit GIF</a>from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/twister-gifs">Twister GIFs</a></div> <script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>



During my first pass I'm acutely focused on locking my
gaze above the heads of the audience, staring off into that deep blue lake. I do
this because it's what Mark told us to do, but mostly because I know if I make
eye contact with a friend I'll immediately crack up.

One performance when I knew I had friends in the audience I did catch myself
smothering a smirk during the nude section. As I strode out towards the audience
I summoned every ounce of concentration in my body to maintain a stoic stare,
but going back I had to crush the grassroots campaign of a grin starting to
organize on my face.

My first two passes contain pretty subtle choreography that help get us in a
groove. My third pass calls for a single skip on each of the first two laps
then three skips each on the next two. First lap I nail it. The best skip you've
ever laid eyes on. No notes. The second lap, however, I get a little
overexuberant and hit the three skips one lap too early. I try to play it off as
best I can and finish out the pass hoping nobody saw that.

Behind the curtain I look to Cate,

"Ugh I accidentally did 3 skips on the second lap. Whoops!"

"OMG I did too!"

"Ha! No way! I guess we're just a little over excited for our first performance"

"Definitely"

Seeing as we were in the middle of the line when we committed our faux pas it
very well could have looked intentional. At least that's what we tell ourselves
as we prepare for our next pass. No time to dwell on the past.

With my gaffe in the rearview we're soon to my absolute favorite part of the piece,
*the pouty pause*. On my last lap of "plastic surgery" we stop for a 4 count at the
end of the stage and give the audience the look of petulant, bratty child who
was just told they couldn't have ice cream. "You're a bratty kid who didn't get
their way and you want to stare at them like you're parents are the worst." I
have a lot of fun with this one & really lean into it. *But I* ***REALLY***
*want ice cream!!! Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh*.

Then comes the spear handoff. The only part I haven't rehearsed dozens of times.
As I reach the yellow panel I snag the spear from Cate and collect 11 rubles
with a flawless pirouette that could only be described as Baryshnikovian. The
quality of the pirouette is only surpassed by my immense modesty.

Outside of my minor skipping miscue the rest of the show goes off without a
hitch. No more flubs, goofs, or blunders. My final pass comes as the music
fades out to silence. 96 steps with no soundtrack but our footsteps. I'm
the very last in the line so my final lap is all alone. No music to keep my
count. No comrades to distract the audience's gaze.

Seeing as this is my first performance (have I mentioned that yet?) my fellow
dancers ask if I'm nervous for my solo. I have a troubling sense of calm about
it. I should be nervous but for reasons I can't explain I'm not.

As I walk off the stage to close out my first ever performance I don't know what
to expect. I gave it a 50-50 shot that I'd get emotional backstage and tear up.
But when it's all said and done the only emotion I feel is pure, unadulterated
bliss. My smile spans the full distance from ear to ear.

As we're hugging backstage I realize that I might not be the only one with first
show jitters. Our curtain call song, a delightful honky tonk swing ditty from
Patsy, has not made its usual appearance. As we're pondering if we should
just take our curtain call without music Patsy starts up. But it's not the right
Patsy. It's *Walkin' After Midnight*, the opening song to the piece. It seems
the technician in charge of the music ran into a snafu playing the song and
made the tactical decision to just play the soundtrack from the piece. We shrug
and run out for the curtain call just like we practiced.

Backstage after we finish our bows McKelynn looks at me with a huge smile on her
face, "oh my god they gave us a standing ovation! That doesn't happen every
time!"

"Well for me it does!" I reply with a shiteating grin. I'm an ornery prick
aren't I?


<h4 class="article-subheader">Are you going to the talkback?</h4>
"The what?"

"The talkback, Mark is going to talk about the piece & do a Q&A"

"Y'all have terms like *adagio* but the forum where a
choreographer discusses their art and creative process is called a talkback?"

*annoyed glares*

"Yes I'm going to the talkback"

I'm just saying that even football coaches have *postgame press conferences*.
I doubt half the coaches in the NFL could spell "conferences." A quarter
probably can't spell "press."

During the talkback we learn about the story of how the piece came to be. Our
current hour-long iteration was incrementally developed over time, with the
original spanning a much more modest 20 minutes.

"The piece is so much about the performing non-performance. Everyone is trying
to look as if they're not aware that people are looking at them even though all
eyes are on them."

"It's based on a very simple pattern that keeps mutating for 14 performers that
also involves about 200 Starbucks cups, 14 rifles, 14 pistols, 15 cell phones,
17 beer cans, and a whole bunch of costumes set to a whole bunch of country
music."

"It developed from an initial urge to play with time
The back and forth wave has a mesmerizing quality that can lull the audience
into a ________ then we change up the pattern and it throws them for a loop.
I want something where the audience is just feeling bored before we change it
up."

During the Q&A my friend Sean asks Mark about his thought process behind using
country music as the soundtrack for the piece.

"Honestly, before this piece I HATED country music! I couldn't stand it! But
after going through and listening to hundreds of songs I have to say it grew on
me and now I love country music. I was just looking for songs with good time
signatures for the walking pattern and country music just seemed to work out
well for that. And there's something about country music that speaks to the
heart of this crazy experiment we have been living in this country"

"People think I'm teasing people with the country music, criticizing America,
saying that I hate this country. But I love this country, we have a lot of great
things going for us, we definitely have our flaws, but 

"Sometimes as artists we can take ourselves & our work too seriously. I'm not
changing the world with this piece. I think that art can make positive changes
in the world but I'm not going to think that everything that I create is going
to change the world. I just wanted to make a piece that was *fun* and I hope that
everyone had fun."


To further my earlier point about differing audience experiences some
participants during the Q&A remarked how individualistic the performance was,
while others were amazed by the cohesive community.





<h4 class="article-subheader">About That Whole Nudity Thing</h4>
I'll admit, when I first saw the video of the Paris performance with *full
nudity* I felt an initial jolt of anxiety mixed with excitement mixed with
trepidation. The trepidation quickly evolved into a silly buzz of immature
mirthfulness. I dispatched a flurry of text messages to my similarly puerile pals
full of cosmopolitan aphorisms such as "hanging dong" in an attempt to encourage
their attendance. My only preparation for the nudity was a strict diet
and maniacal workout program. Because who would know about vainglorious pursuits
more than a man who built an entire website to write about himself.

But I don't want to breeze over the nudity. I'm fully aware that my societal
standing as a man dominates every aspect of how I feel about it. I've never been
catcalled. I've never been told I need to *smile more*. I've never felt unsafe
walking home at night. I've never carried pepper spray. I've never been
uncomfortable in a room full of men. I've never been sexually harassed. I've
never been sexually assaulted.

I've never experienced the innumerable unfortunate and inexcusable incidents
directed at women in our society. I don't know everybody's story, but I have to
assume that each of the women in the company has endured unwanted abuses
however large or small that weighed on their decision to perform this piece.

I'm not brave for walking naked in a room full of people. Alexandra and Renay
and Cate and Allie and McKelynn and Carrie and Alyce and Dana and Linda are.
And I respect and admire them for it.

Throughout the rehearsal process we naturally discussed the nudity from
time to time.  Each woman had a different perspective, a different mindset,
a different journey. And each time this topic was broached, I realized it was
time for me to shut the fuck up and listen and learn.

The most difficult part for most of the women was separating the nudity from
sexuality. Because of what I would argue is a puritanical societal viewpoint,
nudity & sexuality are intimately intertwined. Untying that Gordian knot is the
most difficult part for the women in the performance. But once they were able to
make that cognitive transition it took some of the power from the nudity. When
everybody fosters a desexualized environment it allows us to recognize that
we're simply expressing ourselves with our *bodies*.

Bodies that shit and piss and sweat and fart and wrinkle and bleed and stink and
creak and groan and grow hair in the worst places and lose hair in the best.

The collective agreement to foster an open-minded environment quickly led to the
nude section, at least in my opinion, being pretty matter-of-fact. I'm sure the
fact that we are scrambling to rip off all our clothes as quickly as humanly
possible while remembering our steps for the next pass has at least something
to to with it. But as I stated earlier,
everybody comported themselves in the most professional way possible. The nudity
was always going to be as big or small of a deal as we made it. And we
approached it with a matter-of-fact pragmatism that took the power away from it.

Circling back to
<a href="/entroper/2023_06-this_land/01-you_should_do_this.html?id=red-sparrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Sparrow</a>,
Jennifer Lawrence grappled with accepting the role, knowing it called for nudity.
Her trepidation stemmed from a nude photo leak that sent her into a "long period
when I didn't want to be seen sexually and I didn't want anybody to see my flesh."
Looking back on the role (which required her to learn dance (link)), Lawrence
reflected, “It took a while to say yes – and the night before I didn’t sleep at
all... But then after I finished the scene, I felt empowered.”

I obviously can't speak for Jennifer Lawrence but I'd venture a guess that
My body my terms.

When we strip ourselves of the carapace of modern society we cease to become
Democrats or Republicans, Christians or Jews, citizens or immigrants. Whichever
artificial tribal identity we cling to melts away to reveal that we are
simply *humans*. A condition that does not know national borders, does not
know ethnic divisions, does not know religious rivalries. The more we strip away
the more we realize how similar we all are.


I couldn't resist the urge to shoehorn a Carl Sagan quote here, in his iconic
*Pale Blue Dot* Sagan poetically remarked,

<div class="quote">
The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless
cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely
distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their
misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their
hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors
so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a
fraction of a dot.
</div>

Am I saying the world would be a better place if we all walked around stark
naked in front of a group of strangers? Maybe. Maybe not. But I'd be willing to
give it a shot.


<h4 class="article-subheader">"Holy Shit"</h4>
After the first show of the second night I meet up with a group of friends in
the atrium. Everyone looks totally blown away.

"You totally undersold it, that was amazing!"

"Undersell & overdeliver is what I always say"

"It was so detailed, I was amazed y'all could remember everything, did you have
a system for that?

"Of course, I made a spreadsheet!"

I grab my marked up spreadsheet and show them my system.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Well What Now?</h4>
All of my fellow performers are curious as to my future in the dancing arts.


Do I feel brave?
No
Do I feel proud?
Absolutely

When people ask me how the performance went I say the same thing every time, "it
was one of the most fun experiences of my life." From the moment I walked through
the door for the audition to the moment we took our final bow it was an
unrelenting torrent of joy. A ton of work. But a ton of fun.

I want to thank all my fellow performers for their patience putting up with my
asinine questions and inane jokes of mediocre quality:
Alexandra
Renay
Matt
Cate
Allie
Hendri
McKelynn
Carrie
Andy
Alyce
Jonathan
Brace
Dana
Linda Belans
Aaron

But most of all I want to thank Mark Haim for taking a chance on a hayseed from
Oklahoma with no dane experience to participate in a piece that's so meaningful
to him.


In the second performance I completely lost my count on one of my sideways
passes with skips and just had to wing it. I lost my instruments and just had
to go on feel. Since we had run it through so many times I had gotten a good
feel for my steps and skips. Each skip I had a pretty good feel for when to
fire it off, but luckily I had Renay next to me who really loaded up for each
skip so I could confirm my hunch that it was time for a skip by looking at my
peripherals.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Security</h4>
On the subject of those prop guns everyone calls "toys," we had a minor
emergency in the days leading up to the performance. The toys we rehearsed with
were relatively life-like rifles & pistols. Just a few days before opening
night Mark received a call that the powers that be had decided to outlaw the
guns from the performance. Whether that be the Nasher or Duke or the Durham
police we don't know we just know that 

About 20 minutes before one of the performances I was walking back to the
green room 



<h4 class="article-subheader">Nothin' To Say</h4>
Art is by its very nature a subjective human pursuit. There's no one way, no
right way, no wrong way to create, consume, or appreciate art. It's intimately
individual and that's what makes it beautiful.

In 1971's *Angel From Montgomery*, American mail carryer and lyrical poet John
Prine croons,

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
How the hell can a person<br>
Go to work in the morning<br>
Then come home in the evening<br>
And have nothing to say?
</div>

Which, on the face of it, is a perfectly reasonable question.

But as an introverted young man I came home from school every day and had nothing
to say. I spent hundreds of excruciating car rides dreading the inevitable "what
did you learn in school today?" The thing is I learned plenty in school. I just
wanted to be alone.

But as I've matured and grown I've come to realize there's nothing wrong with
that. There's nothing to be ashamed of. I can be comfortable with *who I am*.
And if you're comfortable with who you are you can deal with uncomfortable
situations. You can fly towards Mount Awkward instead of around it.

So why in the hell am I telling you this?

Because there's absolutely no way that John Prine, when writing about the
failing marriage of a middle aged woman, thought about how the journey of a 35
year man would color his interpretation of the song. It's my self-absorbed and
convoluted way of observing that every single
person who enjoys art brings their own life story to it.

Maybe someone in the audience is related to an ex-wife of Trace Adkins.
Maybe someone had their first kiss with Tim McGraw serenading in the background.
Maybe someone really likes walking in zigzag patterns. Maybe someone texts
all of his brothers every time he hears a Toby Keith song on the radio (ok that
last one is me again).
