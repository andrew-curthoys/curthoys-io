<h4 class="article-subheader">Nothin' To Say</h4>
One most beautiful aspect of art in my opinion is that it's subjective. Every
person who experiences the art brings their life experience & perspective to the
piece

John Prine is one the the greatest American songwriters and I will challenge
anyone to a duel who opines otherwise.

John Prine recorded thousands of lines of recorded lyrical poetry and
certainly wrote tens of thousands more.

In the midst of every one of these lines there's one that drives a stake
deep into the soul of my being.

*How the hell can a person
Go to work in the morning
Then come home in the evening
And have nothing to say?*

As a poet this is a perfectly reasonable question.

As an introverted adolescent whose parents might ask him,

"What did you learn in school today?"

It's a *feeling*.

A feeling that puts you in an exact time and place that your brain is
incapable of forgetting. You faked the answer hundreds of times but for
whatever reason any time you think of the question you can remember the exact
stretch of pavement above which the question was proffered.

And the reason that I went to (school) in the morning then came home in the
evening and had nothing to say is that I just wanted to be alone. I didn't want
to talk to anyone.

I'm fully aware that Uncle John is singing about a failed marriage, but I think
this ties into the reason we crave art. Art is what makes us human. It's an
opinion. It's a disagreement. It's a guy holding onto the microphone too long
at a Q&A.

A bleh_____ will always __________ weigh bleh or something

That's science. And I love science. It's what got me through my adolescence.
The surety. The answers. The black & white. It's what helped make the world
make sense to me. If I was unsure of myself I could at least be sure of the
principles that _____ built upon the __ that__ built yadda yadda

I 

You actually realize what catharsis means. You grab the grief with both hands
and knead it like dough. You sit with it. Your use your introversion
to your advantage. You realize you are a master contemplator. You're
comfortable being alone. You can sit with your thoughts. You can wrestle with
your thoughts. You embrace the pain. You walk through it instead of
around it.

You realize that you have just as much to say as anyone else. You realize that
you do have something to say. The words come gushing out. What the hell is our
word count now? Are you still reading this?

You gain enough confidence where self deprecation is funny and endearing insread
of worrying and tragic. You realize you have a super power. You also acknowledge
much of that power comes from all the seen and unseen advantages that come from
growing up as a white male in an upper middle class stable family in the
heartland of America. You wish everyone could be afforded the same opportunity.

Do you do anything 

Does he spend his time writing nonsense instead of helping the less fortunate?

Yes

Does he feel guilty about it?

Yes

If he says right here on his website that he will help the less fortunate

It sticks with me every time I hear it because I was that person. Substitute
school for work and I was that person that had nothing to say.

The first time I watched the piece, during what I felt was the most powerful
section of the performance, I made an immediate connection to Woody
Guthrie's *This Land Is Your Land*. I asked Mark if that was his intention and
he said he had never even considered it.

<h4 class="article-subheader">It's Art, Get It?</h4>
The most wonderful part of Mark's piece is the fact that there's no message.
There's no agenda. He presents the world the way he sees it and allows the
audience to come to their own conclusion.

At least that's my conclusion.

"Are you going to the talkback?"

"The what now?"

"The talkback"

"Y'all have terms like *adagio* and *pli&eacute;* but the forum in which the
choreographer discusses their art is called a talkback?"

*annoyed glares*

"Yes I'm going to the talkback"

I'm just saying that even football coaches have *postgame press conferences*.
I doubt half the coaches in the NFL could spell "conferences." A quarter
probably can't spell "press."



<h4 class="article-subheader">It's Like A Drug</h4>
The performance

I exist in the dielectic state of craving praise while simultaneously being
wholly unable to accept it.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Well, Here Goes Nothin'</h4>
The hours leading up to the first performance are filled with much milling
about and nonsensical banter.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Overly Excited</h4>
On my third pass I'm supposed to do a single skip on each of the first two laps
then three skips each on the next two. First lap I nail it. The best skip you've
ever laid eyes on. No notes. The second lap, however, I get a little
overexuberant and hit the three skips one lap too early. I try to play it off as
best I can and finish out the pass with no further gaffes.

Behind the curtain I look to Cate,

"Ugh I accidentally did 3 skips on the second lap. Whoops!"

"OMG I did too!"

"Ha! No way! I guess we're just a little over excited for our first performance"

"Definitely"

Seeing as we were in the middle of the line when we committed our faux pas it
very well could have looked intentional. At least that's what we tell ourselves
as we prepare to come out for some maxi skips.
