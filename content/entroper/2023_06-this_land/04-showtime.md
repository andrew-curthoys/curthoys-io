Welp, it only took till my 3rd pass for my first blunder. That set of three
skips you see up there in red? That should have been another single skip - the
triple skips don't come until the *next* lap. Well, *shouldn't* come until the
next lap if we're being pedantic. I know I was bound to mess *something*
up, just didn't think it would happen so quickly. We'll just say I got it out of
the way early.

Behind the curtain after the pass I look at Cate,

"Ugh I accidentally started the 3-skips a lap early. Whoops!"

"OMG I did too!"

"Ha! Seriously?"

"Yeah, I think we're just a little excited for our first performance. It happens."

Seeing as we were in the middle of the line when we committed our faux pas it
very well could have looked intentional. At least that's what we tell ourselves
as we prepare for our next pass. No time to dwell on the past.

With my skipping gaffe in the rearview we're soon to my absolute favorite part of the piece,
*the pouty pause*. On my last lap of "plastic surgery" we stop for a 4 count at the
end of the stage and give the audience the look of petulant child who
was just told they couldn't have ice cream. "You're a bratty kid who didn't get
their way and you want to stare at them like you're parents are the worst." I
have a lot of fun with this one & really lean into it. *But I* ***REALLY***
*want ice cream!!! Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh*.

Then comes the spear handoff. The only part I haven't rehearsed.
As I reach the yellow panel I snag the spear from Cate and collect 11 rubles
with a flawless pirouette that could only be described as Baryshnikovian. The
quality of the pirouette is only surpassed by my immense modesty.

It wasn't long before I goofed again, just a couple passes later during the
military marching sequence. This section features a completely different
walking pattern that the audience has been lulled into expecting for the last
half hour. I make it through the first couple laps just fine then on the third
lap, for whatever reason, my brain lapses and I forget the (Nutcracker/step
together/9-step/whatever name we feel like that day), which throws off my steps
from my comrades. But thankfully we've rehearsed this so many dang times that I
keep my composure and take a little stutter step before our skip and get back
on schedule.

But since all my mental energy was focused on fixing my mistake, I have completely
lost my count. And as I mentioned this section has a skip on the 4-count. Again,
we've rehearsed this so many times I have a pretty good *feel* for where the
skip should go but my ace in the hole is walking right next to me. Renay, I
find, attacks the skip with an aggressiveness that could likely qualify her for
the triple jump at the Olympics. I mean she *really* loads up for it. And I
catch her forceful bounds in my peripherals just to make sure I'm skipping on
the right count for the rest of that pass. Love you Renay <span style="color:red">&hearts;</span>.


<h4 class="article-subheader">It's Art, Get It?</h4>
On the spectrum of human pursuits artistic expression is unique in its
subjectivity. There's no
one way, no right way, no wrong way to create, consume, or appreciate art. And
that's where it derives its beauty. Y'know, the eye of the beholder and whatnot.

In terms of subjectivity Mark Haim's *This Land Is Your Land* is an
extreme exercise on the matter. The piece is so
unfailingly unique that no two audience members will walk out of
the Nasher with the same perspective. And each perspective is perfectly valid.

Even the stage is set up to encourage novel experiences. Arranged in a
configuration that (I just learned) is known as a "thrust stage," the audience
surrounds us on three sides. Personally, I'd call it the "Easy Company"
but Mark calls it an
*interactive viewing experience*. Audience members who are seated directly
facing the stage are treated to a completely different show than those on
the flanks. So even the same person watching the same show from two different
seats may interpret it differently.

<figure class="figure container-fluid">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">The view from house right</figcaption>
</figure>

During my first viewing of the Paris recording I was floored by a connection
between Woody Guthrie's *This Land Is Your Land* and what I considered to be the
most powerful section of Mark's. But that's just the Oklahoma in me.
Each audience member will surely make a connection that feels
just as profound to them as my Woody Guthrie connection did to me.

Byron Woods, the theater & dance critic for INDY Week, a Durham-based
independent newspaper, wrote of the piece, "flashy movers on a serpentine
catwalk execute a slow pan across a landscape of mindless consumerism in Mark
Haim’s roast, 'This Land Is Your Land,' at the Nasher Museum."

Audience members after the show commented on the sense of isolation in the
piece. The lack of connection between the six dancers on stage, each weaving
their own way through the world. Then others remarked on the feeling of
community woven throughout the piece. It's individualistic. But it's also
community. A dance. But also not a dance. A statement. But not a statement.

It's an artistic expression that exposes salient aspects of our
culture, but the most wonderful part is the fact that there's no message.
There's consumerism but it's not a comment on consumerism. There's 
There are guns but it's not a piece about guns. The guns are simply *there*.
Each audience member can decide how that makes them feel and what it means to
them. In this piece there's no agenda. It's simply Mark presenting the world the
way he sees it and allowing the audience to come to their own conclusions.

At least that's my conclusion.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Dress Rehearsal</h4>
The day before opening night we mosey over to the Nasher for a full dress
rehearsal in the *interactive viewing experience*. When I stroll into the
capacious atrium of the museum my jaw drops to the floor. 45 feet overhead a
web of glass and steel gracefully hovers above the 13,000 square foot Great Hall.
The ferrosilicate web is conjointly supported by 5 immense beams, none of which
span the room's full breadth. It's somewhat like
that classic dad trick of folding the flaps of a cardboard box to stay shut
without tape. It's a beautiful piece of engineering.

In the words of Rafael Vi&ntilde;oly, the Uruguayan-born architect, he
conceived of the the Nasher as a

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
<p>
  Collection of five separate, rectangular volumes arranged in a loose radial
  pattern near the top of a gentle slope define an irregular, pentagonal central
  courtyard topped by a glass roof. The complex, almost vertiginous geometries of
  the atrium roof are formed by a hierarchy of structural systems, all supported
  on five primary beams.
</p>
<p>
  This seemingly simple network of structural supports adds rhythm, lightness,
  scale, and openness to the column-free public lobby and event space at the
  heart of the museum and also incorporates the building’s mechanical systems.
</p>
</div>

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Look at that roof! Vertiginous geometries!</figcaption>
</figure>

It's a magical venue. It's also my first introduction to the bewildering
experience of rehearsing in a new space. During our first dress
at the Nasher I make mistakes I haven't made in over a week. I can't keep my
count. I can't remember my choreography. I'm fully discombobulated. It certainly
doesn't help that the green slate floor tiles are slanted at an angle oblique to
our walking path.

After the run-through I ask my fellow performers if they had similar
struggles and they confirm as much.

"Every time you rehearse at a new place that will happen. You'll be alright,
that's why we did this."

Phew. Did I mention my co-performers are fabulous people?

For our second dress rehearsal we are graced with an audience. Members of the
ADF staff and participants in the summer dance intensive who have schedule
conflicts fill the Great Hall for our last run-through before the big day.
Much the same as the venue adds a new layer to the performance, a live audience
significantly changes the dynamic. I'm grateful that we are able to rehearse
here *and* with an audience. As an engineer I'm always on
the lookout to isolate as many variables as possible.

Then right before the first performance Mark adds another variable.

"Andy, I know we haven't practiced this but I want you to grab the spear from
Cate and carry it offstage."

<i>Sure thing, Mark, let's just throw a last minute curveball to the dancer
who'd be more comfortable hitting a <b>literal</b> curveball.</i>

"Yeah, no problem," I say with a false confidence that hopefully belies the fact
that it's at the very least a small problem.

So I practice the spear handoff a few times with Cate, a move that requires a
pirouette opposite of our normal direction. And of course a last minute
scribble on my spreadsheet.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Let's Get On With It</h4>
Outside of the 11th hour spearouette addition I feel ready. Rehearsals have
worn me down and I'm ready for the real thing. I've got my
system down. I'm prepared. Calm. Confident.

That night I sleep like a damn baby. When I arise I find a ladybug on my pillow -
that's gotta be good luck right? But then again, maybe I
<a href="https://dancespirit.com/history-of-merde/" target="_blank" rel="noopener no referrer">don't want good luck</a>?
I'm not really sure what to make of dancer superstitions.

I arrive to the Nasher a few hours ahead of our 6:30 PM show. Around 4:30
we do a tech rehearsal, which I learn is just a breezy run-through with the
music but no costumes or props. Like a Thursday football practice with no pads.

<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/entroper/2023_06-this_land/perf-dress1.jpg" alt="Dress rehearsal">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Notice how everyone else is focused on
  the task at hand whilst yours truly sticks his tongue out at the camera</figcaption>
</figure>

The time between tech & performance is filled with much milling about and
nonsensical banter. I'm confident but still stress eat about half of the
potluck snacks. Thomas Earl Petty was right about The Waiting. Our heroic stage
manager, Gabby, has the
unenviable job of appeasing contingents from the Nasher, ADF, and the
security detail, all while wrangling a group of nervy performers.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Durham Dance Mafia album cover</figcaption>
</figure>

15 minutes before showtime Gabby leads us from the green room backstage. We chat
idly, review notes, stretch out, waiting anxiously just to get the show on the
road. 6:30 comes and goes.

Dana reassures me, "these things never start on time, I'm sure there are still
people shuffling in"

A few minutes later Gabby comes backstage and calmly tells us we'll be starting
in 5. And in 5 minutes I'm greeted, once again, by that familiar contralto,

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
I go out walkin' after midnight...
</div>

I take a load off and watch the organized chaos unfold around me.
For each of their early passes, Alexandra, Renay, Matt, Cate, Allie, Hendri, and
McKelynn are forced to make a frantic backstage scramble. They have 12 counts to
make it from one edge of the curtain to the other, lest they miss their next
pass. The frenzied scurrying continues until Carrie joins the ranks,
providing a much needed respite for the beleaguered troops.

Around 4 minutes in, during my favorite Pontoon DockRock ballad, I rise from my
comfortable lounged position, grab a cup and step in line right behind Cate.

One - Two - Three - Four

And Cate is off.

*Five - Six - Seven - Eight*

I step up to my mark at the edge of the curtain.

***One - Two - Three - Four***

And on the 5 I take my first step onto the stage in my inaugural performance as
a dancer...


<h4 class="article-subheader">About That Whole Nudity Thing</h4>
I'll admit, when I first saw the video of the Paris performance with *full
nudity* I felt an initial jolt of anxiety mixed with excitement mixed with
trepidation. The trepidation quickly gave way to a rolling cascade of immature
mirthfulness. In short order I dispatched a flurry of texts to my similarly
puerile pals riddled with cosmopolitan aphorisms such as "hanging dong" and
"cock out walk out." My only
preparation, mental or otherwise, was a diet and workout program - because
who would know about vainglorious pursuits more than a man who built an entire
website to write about himself?

<figure class="figure container-fluid">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/entroper/2023_06-this_land/perf-nekked_eggplant.jpg" alt="Eggplant">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Just like Dolph Lundgren in Thundergun 4</figcaption>
</figure>

But I don't want to breeze over the nudity. Because I'm fully aware that the
simple fact that I'm a man affords me the luxury of such a carefree approach.
It's all cheeky and fun for me. But I've never been
catcalled. I've never been told I need to *smile more*. I've never felt unsafe
walking home at night. I've never carried pepper spray. I've never been
uncomfortable in a room full of men. I've never been sexually harassed. I've
never been sexually assaulted. I've never experienced the countless
inexcusable behaviors directed at women in our society.

So I have no idea what these women must grapple with to be *that* vulnerable in
front of *that* many people. I've written at length in this story about getting
out of my comfort zone. But I'm not brave. Alexandra
and Renay and Cate and Allie and McKelynn and Carrie and Alyce and Dana and
Linda are. And I respect and admire them for it.

<p class="section-divider my-4">&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;&emsp;&ensp;&#11044;</p>

Unsurprisingly the topic of nudity often arose during our long hours of
rehearsals. Each woman had a different perspective, a different mindset,
a different journey. And each time the topic was broached, I knew it was
time for me to shut up and listen and learn.

But I didn't have to consult with my partner about
exposing myself to a group of strangers. I didn't have to discuss nudity and
sexuality with my kids. Or my grandkids. I'm not a member of the dance community
who will I'm not

The most difficult part, it seems, was separating the nudity from sexuality.
Because our puritanical societal norms impose an implicit
belief that nudity is intertwined with sexuality and sexuality is
intertwined with shame and judgement. The ability to untie that
tangled knot requires transcendent levels of patience, confidence, and
self-awareness. But once each woman in the company was able to make that
cognitive dissociation it seemed to deprive the nudity of all its power.

Because at the end of the day we're all just *bodies*.
Bodies that shit and piss and sweat and fart and wrinkle and bleed and stink and
creak and groan and grow hair in the worst places and lose hair in the best.

The more we strip away the more we realize how similar we all are.

And I think we could all use a little reminder of that from time to time.


<h4 class="article-subheader">Quick Change</h4>
Throughout the course of the 1 hour piece I have 13 different looks. They don't
all require a full outfit change; some are just an accessory here, new top there,
different pair of jeans. But a substantial wardrobe to keep track of nonetheless.
Before each performance I neatly stack each article of clothing in reverse order
of their appearance.

<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/entroper/2023_06-this_land/perf-wardrobe_before.jpeg" alt="Before">
</figure>

And each costume change I frantically tear off my clothes & throw them into a
pile. Entropy increasing with every pass.

<figure class="figure">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid mt-2 rounded" src="/theme/images/entroper/2023_06-this_land/perf-wardrobe_after.jpeg" alt="After">
</figure>

If only the audience could take a peek behind the curtain. A
sweaty maelstrom of flying blouses, jettisoned jeans, and the occasional mad
dash to get in position just before your entrance. It took a few rehearsals to
find out where we had a little buffer to take a breath and where we really
needed to hustle. And which articles were the trickiest. For me it was my socks.
With time I discovered that the secret was known by Rabbit from Twister all
along: Roll The Maps (Socks).

<div class="tenor-gif-embed mb-3" data-postid="14663539" data-share-method="host" data-aspect-ratio="1.92771" data-width="100%"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/twister-rabbit-wise-good-gif-14663539">Twister Rabbit GIF</a>from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/twister-gifs">Twister GIFs</a></div> <script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>

For many others, tight fitting jeans proved to be their nemesis. During a
particularly stuffy day in the studio Alyce proposed a remedy to the denim dilemma,

"If you coat the inside of your jeans with baby powder it helps get them on
when you're sweaty!"

I take a moment to appreciate the simultaneous absurdity and sensibleness of the
previous statement. I look at Alyce with a bemused smirk,

"If you would have told me on New Year's Eve that I'd hear 'if you coat the
inside of your jeans with baby powder' this year I'd have thought 'well 2023
is gonna be a weird year.'"

<h4 class="article-subheader">Deep Blue Lake</h4>
For our passes with a "neutral" facial expression, i.e. no smiling, scowling,
or sneering, Mark instructs us to imagine we're staring off into a deep blue
lake, past the heads of the seated audience. Which, on the face of it, sounds
like nonsense. But for whatever reason we all know *exactly* what he means. It's
so nonsense that it makes sense.

So during these passes my mind's eye is locked in on
<a href="/traveler/2022_01-ski_trip/03-wine.html?id=crater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crater Lake</a>,
the deepest lake in the United States filled with pristine Pacific Northwest
precipitation. That deep and blue enough for ya?

The most useful part of the note for me is the fact that making eye contact with
a friend in the audience will immediately cause me to crack up. The first
performance of day 2 I catch myself smothering a smirk during the nude section
because I know my friends are in attendance. As I stride out towards the audience
I summon every ounce of concentration in my body to maintain a stoic stare;
on the way back I have to ruthlessly crush the grassroots campaign of a grin
organizing a jocund labor movement on my face.

During another section Mark gave his note for our facial expression thusly, "I
want you to convince yourself you are the front line in the war for Democracy,
dammit!"

</figure>

A few passes later we're carrying pistols Mark instructs us to wear
a dead-eyed thousand yard stare. A catatonic numbness so deep we don't even
realize we're carrying a pistol. Which comes naturally to me - I was raised
Catholic.

</figure>


<h4 class="article-subheader">Ovation</h4>
My final pass of the performance comes as the music
fades out to silence. 96 steps with no soundtrack but our footsteps. I'm
the very last in the line so my final lap is all alone. No music to keep my
count. No comrades to distract the audience's gaze.

<figure class="figure">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't
  have too much to say</figcaption>
</figure>

Seeing as this is my first performance (have I mentioned that yet?) my fellow
dancers ask if I'm nervous for my solo. I have a troubling sense of calm about
it. I should be nervous but for reasons I can't explain I'm not.



As I walk off the stage to close out my first ever performance I don't know what
to expect. I gave it a 50-50 shot that I'd get emotional backstage and tear up.
But when it's all said and done the only emotion I feel is pure, unadulterated
bliss. My smile spans the full distance from ear to ear.

As we're hugging backstage I realize that I might not be the only one with first
show jitters. Our curtain call song, a delightful honky tonk swing ditty from
Patsy, has not made its usual appearance. As we're pondering if we should
just take our curtain call without music Patsy starts up. But it's not the right
Patsy. It's *Walkin' After Midnight*, the opening song to the piece. It seems
the technician in charge of the music ran into a snafu playing the song and
made the tactical decision to just play the soundtrack from the piece. We shrug
and run out for the curtain call just like we practiced.

Backstage after we finish our bows McKelynn looks at me with a huge smile on her
face, "oh my god they gave us a standing ovation! That doesn't happen every
time!"

"Well for me it does!" I reply with a shiteating grin. I'm an ornery prick
aren't I?


<h4 class="article-subheader">Are you going to the talkback?</h4>
"The what?"

"The talkback, Mark is going to talk about the piece & do a Q&A"

"Y'all have terms like *adagio* but the forum where a
choreographer discusses their art and creative process is called a talkback?"

*annoyed glares*

"Yes I'm going to the talkback"

I'm just saying that even football coaches have *postgame press conferences*.
I doubt half the coaches in the NFL could spell "conferences." A quarter
probably can't spell "press."

During the talkback we learn about the story of how the piece came to be. Our
current hour-long iteration was incrementally developed over time, with the
original spanning a much more modest 20 minutes.

"It developed from an initial urge to play with time.
The back and forth wave has a mesmerizing quality that lulls the audience
into a trance then we change up the pattern and it .
I want something where the audience is just feeling bored before we change it
up."

"The piece is so much about the performing non-performance. Everyone is trying
to look as if they're not aware that people are looking at them even though all
eyes are on them."

"It's based on a very simple pattern that keeps mutating for 14 performers that
also involves about 200 Starbucks cups, 14 rifles, 14 pistols, 15 cell phones,
17 beer cans, and a whole bunch of costumes set to a whole bunch of country
music."

During the Q&A my friend Sean asks Mark about his thought process behind using
country music as the soundtrack for the piece.

"Honestly, before this piece I HATED country music! I couldn't stand it! But
after going through and listening to hundreds of songs I have to say it grew on
me and now I love country music. I was just looking for songs with good time
signatures for the walking pattern and country music just seemed to work out
well for that. And there's something about country music that speaks to the
heart of this crazy experiment we have been living in this country"

"People think I'm teasing people with the country music, criticizing America,
saying that I hate this country. But I love this country, we have a lot of great
things going for us, we definitely have our flaws, but 

"Sometimes as artists we can take ourselves & our work too seriously. I'm not
changing the world with this piece. I think that art can make positive changes
in the world but I'm not going to think that everything that I create is going
to change the world. I just wanted to make a piece that was *fun* and I hope that
everyone had fun."


<h4 class="article-subheader">Well What Now?</h4>
I've had many friends ask why I wanted to do this. Friends who understand all
the sports references I've made and none of the dance ones. Friends who wouldn't
know Monica Bill Barnes if she walked in the room and did her best Monica Bill
Barnes impression. And I don't have a satisfactory answer for them.

All of my fellow performers are curious as to my future in the dancing arts.
I've enrolled in some dance classes. I've learned what second position is. I can
(kinda?) do a tandu. We're still working on my flexibility but it's been a blast.
I'm open to any and all performances that require little to no dance experience
and/or clothing. I would do this performance again in a heartbeat.

I want to thank all my fellow performers for their patience putting up with my
asinine questions and inane jokes of mediocre quality:

Alexandra

Renay

Matt

Cate

Allie

Hendri

McKelynn

Carrie

Alyce

Jonathan

Brace

Dana

Linda Belans

Aaron

But most of all I want to thank Mark Haim for taking a chance on an inexperienced
hayseed from Oklahoma to participate in a piece that's so meaningful to him.

When people ask me how the performance went I say the same thing every time, "it
was one of the most fun experiences I've ever been a part of." From the moment I
walked through
the door for the audition to the moment we took our final bow it was an
unrelenting torrent of joy.

A ton of work.

But a ton of fun.

And I'll never regret taking that blind pirouette into the unknown.


I've been agonizing how to end this essay but maybe it's not the end. Maybe this
is just the beginning of my journey in the wonderful world of dance.


In the second performance I completely lost my count on one of my sideways
passes with skips and just had to wing it. I lost my instruments and just had
to go on feel. Since we had run it through so many times I had gotten a good
feel for my steps and skips. Each skip I had a pretty good feel for when to
fire it off, but luckily I had Renay next to me who really loaded up for each
skip so I could confirm my hunch that it was time for a skip by looking at my
peripherals.

<h4 class="article-subheader">Security</h4>
On the subject of those prop guns everyone calls "toys," we had a minor
emergency in the days leading up to the performance. The toys we rehearsed with
were relatively life-like rifles & pistols. Just a few days before opening
night Mark received a call that the powers that be had decided to outlaw the
guns from the performance. Whether that be the Nasher or Duke or the Durham
police we don't know we just know that 

About 20 minutes before one of the performances I was walking back to the
green room 



<h4 class="article-subheader">Nothin' To Say</h4>
Art is by its very nature a subjective human pursuit. There's no one way, no
right way, no wrong way to create, consume, or appreciate art. It's intimately
individual and that's what makes it beautiful.

In 1971's *Angel From Montgomery*, American mail carryer and lyrical poet John
Prine croons,

<div class="text-muted fst-italic mx-3 mb-3">
How the hell can a person<br>
Go to work in the morning<br>
Then come home in the evening<br>
And have nothing to say?
</div>

Which, on the face of it, is a perfectly reasonable question.

But as an introverted young man I came home from school every day and had nothing
to say. I spent hundreds of excruciating car rides dreading the inevitable "what
did you learn in school today?" The thing is I learned plenty in school. I just
wanted to be alone.

But as I've matured and grown I've come to realize there's nothing wrong with
that. There's nothing to be ashamed of. I can be comfortable with *who I am*.
And if you're comfortable with who you are you can deal with uncomfortable
situations. You can fly towards Mount Awkward instead of around it.

So why in the hell am I telling you this?

Because there's absolutely no way that John Prine, when writing about the
failing marriage of a middle aged woman, thought about how the journey of a 35
year man would color his interpretation of the song. It's my self-absorbed and
convoluted way of observing that every single
person who enjoys art brings their own life story to it.

Maybe someone in the audience is related to an ex-wife of Trace Adkins.
Maybe someone had their first kiss with Tim McGraw serenading in the background.
Maybe someone really likes walking in zigzag patterns. Maybe someone texts
all of his brothers every time he hears a Toby Keith song on the radio (ok that
last one is me again).

I obviously don't know everyone's story but I
have to imagine that each of the women in the company has endured unwanted
abuses however large or small. that weighed on their decision to perform this piece.





I couldn't resist the urge to shoehorn a Carl Sagan quote here, in his iconic
*Pale Blue Dot* Sagan poetically remarked,

<div class="quote">
The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless
cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely
distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their
misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their
hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors
so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a
fraction of a dot.
</div>

Am I saying the world would be a better place if we all walked around stark
naked in front of a group of strangers? Maybe. Maybe not. But I'd be willing to
give it a shot.


Recently on one of my favorite podcasts, *Penpals* hosted by my two favorite
cackling idiots

Circling back to
<a href="/entroper/2023_06-this_land/01-you_should_do_this.html?id=red-sparrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Sparrow</a>,
Jennifer Lawrence grappled with accepting the role, knowing it called for nudity.
Her trepidation stemmed from a nude photo leak that sent her into a "long period
when I didn't want to be seen sexually and I didn't want anybody to see my flesh."
Looking back on the role (which required her to learn dance (link)), Lawrence
reflected, “It took a while to say yes – and the night before I didn’t sleep at
all... But then after I finished the scene, I felt empowered.”

<h4 class="article-subheader">"Holy Shit"</h4>
After the first show of the second night I meet up with a group of friends in
the atrium. Everyone looks completely blown away.

"You totally undersold it, that was amazing!"

"Undersell & overdeliver, that's what I always say"

"It was so detailed, how did you remember all that?"

"I made a spreadsheet of course!"

I grab my marked up spreadsheet and show them my system.



When we strip away the carapace of modern society we cease to become Democrats or
Republicans, Christians or Jews, citizens or immigrants. Whichever
artificial tribal identity we cling to. And what's left is our humanity. A
condition that does not know national borders, does not
know ethnic divisions, does not know religious rivalries.
